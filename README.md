# Neual-Machine-Translation
Bidirectional LSTM with Multiplicative Attention
Neural Machine Translation is to convert a sentence from the source language (e.g. French) to the target language (e.g. English). In this assignment, we will implement a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) network with attention, to build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system. In this section, we describe the training procedure for the proposed NMT system, which uses a Bidirectional LSTM Encoder and a Unidirectional LSTM Decoder.
