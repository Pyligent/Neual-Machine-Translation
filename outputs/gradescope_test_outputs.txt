So part of practical practice is recognizing that under stress we will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation that when you face themselves in front of a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or one dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all decision-making, medical decisions, and in fact to make financial decisions and of social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you're going to go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the outcome of the lab and your cholesterol cholesterol result.
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack the heart of <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, and it's likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you must ask for the most doctors don't want to speak, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number needs to try.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or having a surgery in any medical procedure before you can help one person.
And you must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor will not tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's somebody's fault from scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number required to treat the most widely <unk> which you think it is?
How many people have to take it to one person?
300.
This is the research of the <unk> researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke brain or other <unk>
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for more statistic and it is, <unk> the effects of <unk> Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include these things -- <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The Five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress don't think very clearly.
So think about how to do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that you can help you.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your physician.
<unk> ethic is a part of the informed consent principle.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
And you may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air of the crash value, but actually this number we need to try is pretty typical.
For the surgery that is done in the biggest men of 50, <unk> prostate prostate prostate prostate cancer, the number required to treat is <unk>
That's why 49 surgeries per person who has <unk>
And side effects in that case, they produce 50 percent of the patients.
Those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of before the questions that you can argue that we would take the conversation forward.
You don't have to do all this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice so many times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain in the end?
These are the things they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> Face with a <unk> we don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, it will not react to be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought, rational thinking like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail at time.
The idea is to think about the future how those people might be able to put systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things to happen in the first place.
<unk> at night in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor in my journey, I installed a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the door to the same door to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't <unk> and lots of email messages I haven't seen.
So I'm not very <unk> but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can ever be <unk>
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own history.
The language of French signs came over the decade of 1800, and at the time step of time, they mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we know as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a <unk> world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following blind their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do you understand the sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my <unk> and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people aspire to.
So I've learned for example ...
"I don't know the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat the bag of potato potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you make sure not <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> to keep going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines are already contain sounds through <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In the culture of culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to do whatever it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my pictures, I have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my art <unk>
I'm going to give you more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through your ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that I had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was stuck with the amount of support and attention that I got.
And I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could get it up.
I chose I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, to <unk> his voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If you will not continue with this practice, I feel that I might be able to be able to put it into <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't catch and express on paper.
And the same is true of a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning so much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different <unk>
If you put a different <unk> for each finger as the facial expression, the movement of the body, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so, while it hits the piano, English is a linear language -- as if you get just a key at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 fingers in the way to express a very clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If just a key change would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> they can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the music?
If I had to create a sign and put it back again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is <unk> day."
If you put it up, and you get the speed -- visually speed, you see as a piece of music.
Every day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to you, the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this picture.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel the third one has more <unk> than the other other two.
This is what time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present one becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a music term with a specific rate of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think it automatically is going to be at <unk> itself.
Look at <unk> right, <unk> right hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a shape of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of your hands in top.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages worldwide.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third is <unk> please, again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job all.
So look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest but they're making very different meanings of it.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and twice as the music.
However, today, we live in a very crowded world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to grow its own value without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> and you don't have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich, and I would like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to ask you to open up your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
Happiness involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence of innocence or a bubble bubble bubble -- I must say, because adults would lie to us from the horrible truth.
When I became older, I found out that adults also <unk> and they're not very good to clean up from others.
The country, now I'm adult and teach citizenship and invention at the <unk> School of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we have the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans are <unk> plastic.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those bits of plastic to study it under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use these huge ships.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream about inventing a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> work with <unk> so that the kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I will tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce the size we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My work is to try to take the best ideas in every child, and try to figure it out in something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting plastic pieces, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot with the robots.
And then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so quick in the creation of prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we transform light bulbs and web cameras in return, and you put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see plastic pieces, floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measuring the size of each <unk> to get a <unk> estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I put this invention back on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else will do it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem, <unk> But my students in Hong Kong are very well kids.
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you get <unk> with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years ago, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and mud and oil are also brown color and when everything gets <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what there is in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I do research with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it took several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died in a moment.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power near the water.
And today, according to the average of 300 tons of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If you go to the West Coast, we can measure radiation radiation, everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems to be that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the majority, at the time, is all of sure, and it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and performs independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to take the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents didn't get it.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here is the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discuss the data -- that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition -- the closest to the date.
We get closer to a mile of nuclear central, and with the fishermen of the fishermen of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> of sediment as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales with open-source technologies and very simple source.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so much, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with <unk> metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, can basically be built almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children may become reality with adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Well, we can help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard wheels in new vehicles in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth, because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizens scientists, creators, we have to make the next generation for the environment and the people, and so it can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made out of thousands of steel, <unk> the other one of a silk silk net.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposes over the environment, the other thing I did.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo, angel said that when he looked at the raw, he saw a figure that fights for being free.
<unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smaller units of life, cells, we took all the information to take it for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools have also consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by manufacturing of manufacturing and mass production.
The lines of <unk> have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think their objects like <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial <unk> are thin with <unk> pore.
The skins of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
You are acting mainly like <unk> the other mostly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that varies its functionality through <unk> variation.
Here is a split screen that represents the <unk> of every designer and an architect of every designer and an architect in working between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis, and seriously, is shown in the two screens behind me.
My job at the most simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving away from assembly and getting to growth.
You probably are wondering why now?
Why couldn't this be 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment where they have four disciplines that offers designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, and structures and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters of diameter with a <unk> basis that some day not very far too far to print <unk> buildings and graphics <unk> made of genetically <unk> <unk>
So here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every single aperture is just size to model light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a real fashion fashion fashion with <unk> they're going <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with a 3D printing collaborator we printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> on the cells. I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in <unk> <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of an MRI scanner as well.
That designers have access to this high-tech <unk> and the <unk> instruments it allows to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair a chair at the very comfortable structural chair and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter teacher, my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this pattern of <unk> it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
His surface, as in nature, it varies its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
But it's <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them came up and got to define a lot of what I care about.
Like she said, "In the third day of the <unk> God sends Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree, there would be no difference in the trunk, but just leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of thing.
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made out of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design if the objects were made of a single part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material that the <unk> material of the tree filled with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year by organisms like shrimp, or <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune their properties, we could generate <unk> structures.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We asked a lot of husks of <unk> <unk> and produced toothpaste <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the <unk> structures that built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of material about the march and create these structures made from one material 3.5 feet long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are lists, it leaves dry to find a natural way in contact with air.
So why are we still designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, they took the bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of focusing on mesh and if it extends even more to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best <unk> for <unk> <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, will help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we should master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> <unk> we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> in biological form.
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals are <unk> new biological convictions within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
So we <unk> our own 3D channels.
In our first piece of clothes, you know, two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the waters of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human genome.
One turns the light in sugar, the other <unk> and it produces the amount of biofuels for the built environment.
But these two objects don't interact in nature.
In fact, never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution for design.
So to hold these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like to the tract <unk> that will help us to <unk> these bacteria and to help their function function.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> they were more transparent channels.
So this <unk> system <unk> when you stretch from one end to another, it is 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside of your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are early days -- only half is <unk>
What if design would get the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the damaged tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer is made out of layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture that is a home inside which is <unk>
<unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers in each other.
And this is happening through scales.
The spider silk worm is turning into the environment, it creates a structure of tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with sensing sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots on three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the <unk> of the <unk>
However, by putting the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different environments, different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
Often the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it uses the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that these silk silk worms are going into more dark and <unk> areas that we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
And so we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, <unk> silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get <unk>
We asked <unk> silk worms to a line.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to be <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk on spider silk <unk> give all this canopy from the integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, you know, <unk> silk worms.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which takes us from a design inspired by nature inspired by design, which demands for us, for the first time, that we make it for nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time this?
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the arts and developing websites, I would play the guitar on a punk named <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having dedicated time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to go on.
But then I went through something else, something completely different -- and I get stuck in it, and I just let myself absorb and I feel <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to go on.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all of my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason why caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for no longer <unk> at all.
I was afraid to be afraid of engagement, or whether it's worthwhile or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to ask you back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where to do it, they learned it from culture.
We ask you first what do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what I was talking about.
It's considered a naive question to create nice responses in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is given to us over and over as we grow different forms of <unk> <unk> to high school students are asking you to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what gives us the dream.
Why?
If this question is well inspired by children to dream with what they might be, not inspires to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even though the good <unk> you might good <unk> and say, "Oh, what are you cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have choice.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of the fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something that you're going to spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different themes that wake up and a lot of different things that he wants to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel itself.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for that say.
Could it be able to help if you split up in three <unk> <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we have to do the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You have any term that you like or you would get your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as <unk> or woe you should win.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being like this.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in <unk> visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, to start <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea of its <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening in the intersections.
That's coming up the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning learning.
When we put them up, we go into something, we're going to do that.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk> and <unk>
As a child, a <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before to become a writer, I was <unk> for financial <unk>
It had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when their practices, and this ability would help write compelling tests for the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to have a loss of time to give you even if at the end of the end.
It's possible to apply that knowledge into a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. That is the ability to transform into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of musical videos, other online pages, sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of your customers.
<unk> magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market, which is actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you might lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a huge interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers not conventional to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> off the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong on you.
In fact, some of the best teams become a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The signature can dive forward and put in practice, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all be designing lives and careers that we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a lot of them are told to just be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing you can take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with internal behavior, whatever it is.
If you are a heart, then you put it for all the media.
That's where you give the best of you.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized is one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
Let's get the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more happy and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, we <unk> the world to us.
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman named <unk> they brought it to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately, passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If you could have been living today, we could not give it to her more help than <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
From <unk> medicine has come up with a lot.
They have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer cancer, for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But a little bit of progress has been done in Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that by the way, including a lot of you.
If you expect to live until age 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of two.
In other words, there is the chance that their years to spend their years or Alzheimer's disease or helping care of a friend or to be like Alzheimer's disease.
Just in America, Alzheimer's dollars costs 200 dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs in five times in 2050, as 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest social and social challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little made to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 percent of all over the world, Alzheimer's disease is the only one that cannot be <unk> to cure or even slow down of development.
We understand less from Alzheimer's percent of other diseases because we spend less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research research in Alzheimer's spite of the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and cause a number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but everyone -- Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all, scientists, scientists, scientists, Alzheimer's Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just have to look at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison with a healthy patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and skills, the damage to the brain caused significantly to significantly reduce life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of molecules of proteins.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that looks like a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are going to stay on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plate and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are lots of steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as a bomb.
You know, a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we do it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in its most part, they have reduced wires and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, biologists, <unk> physicists, physicists, engineers and <unk>
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process, and now it's testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when you test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have the protein molecules that stick into each other, as well as humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial result of positive, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, to overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to think about Alzheimer's disease is a disease and that if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, and pharmaceutical scientists and <unk>
That was essential to move forward in HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today, we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to come out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimers is not most of the cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I put this article in the spine Love <unk> from the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when I test it back in the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to get 36 more and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number one: When was the last time you put on to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> are increasingly personal.
Number three: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like from him or it, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say someone you've recently known.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me for attention, the gadget two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we were <unk> and  And I thought it was a good story, so I send him to the column Love <unk> a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably going to be wondering, keep it up together.
And the reason I think I'm doing this is because they've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before the paper was published was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been fascinated by writing about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my friends from Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times has probably a few thousands of view.
And that came up with a good burden of attention to a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article published on line on a Friday night, and the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I've already been called the Holy <unk> and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million pages, and I was like, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with <unk> and another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or I was writing about what every day for weeks, they were doing first the same question: still still together?
In fact, when I was setting up this talk, I did a quick quest in the inbox, of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
These were students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk -- and a woman rushed to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately became red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for Saint <unk> who included the experiences of readers when I test the study of them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
I put on television interviews, and we would take orders from photos of us two.
I think I was afraid I was afraid to become the icons of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked work, they wanted to know if they really wanted to know if it was really <unk> or not just an adventure, but not just a real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, especially the wrong question of the wrong question.
How do you know if you go together or not, and they also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions at this same study in 1997. And there, the objective of researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, he was looking for interpersonal approach, between university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But study it worked.
Participants felt closer to the participants more close to doing it. Several later studies used the <unk> protocol as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have been used by members of the police and the community. And they used it to be used by people of opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was cited in this paper, but unfortunately he never got published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk about a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and it didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, you want to say that you get rid of the person who you do it.
Well he made a break.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they managed to get better to test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and was going through a really hard separation to me.
He had been that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to be pretty much all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and he had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I focused on science.
And I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I was hoping that that could be a kind of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I was just going to work for the book that I would write -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was <unk> with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I sat back then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful from one or a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I am.
But I can also see me more clearly -- and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably much more than reasonably much as you can demand me.
So I'm looking for the love of the love of love -- not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> depending on the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media heard about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some mode to mitigate some of the risk of the risk, and this is a very controversial story, because fall in love to feel <unk> but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that says, still still together?
And their content with an answer or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that we ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How are things going to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live in the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> paper, love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit at reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that I was supposed to think about.
It didn't think of how many times we would have both of that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done enough and responded 36 questions, and I have chosen to love someone so generous, <unk> and a lot of fun and having expressed that choice in the largest U.S. newspaper.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think of.
And what I <unk> and what I might have to spend my life for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper that I didn't actually have written.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also loved me, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a <unk> in broad mountain, and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York do a time.  Something that really affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wood box of wood, and you put a bill for a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later and I'm still doing boxes.
In a moment he was in <unk> <unk> I like to go from tour and make <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style of Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of the bees and it's <unk> to them, so I put more resin on the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite of it in a way that it seemed like it grew up the size of size, as if it was that they put the text with a <unk>
So I did so. I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic frogs and out of weird frogs that was finding out of the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things my whole life, trying to figure out and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God -- I can draw in space.
I can flow by drawing -- just like a <unk> of a crime.
And I pulled out objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you can get an idea.
I then did some insects and really strangers.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was gaining some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great -- man.
At some point I was interested in the human form, sculptures of resin size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was shocked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing on a window, and then in another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that are a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked -- and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the <unk> Museum in Spain.
You know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It's 11,000 pounds.
Five feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animals are travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are heading at the <unk> lists of suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied up to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama bin Laden, there's all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out of the other hand.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird, like a bird, and it spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> a <unk> tail that binds to the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn into a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
His tail ends up in an eye of <unk> made out of terrorist cards in 1986.
Have you <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball baseball cards.
Very <unk> for his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they come together.
And you can walk between them. I'm carrying them.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> that weighs 1,300 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can get it to the ticket.
I will see you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and he covers the penis or whatever it is, you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body.
This has two heads and is communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and go into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We are in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, an <unk> a museum, a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world, and a garden.
It takes the box and all of the people from inside each other as the particles.
And I think that's how to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that's living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the frontiers of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first happens by the stomach, the guts and other organs.
So I'm going to take a pill to be the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug will effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these serve to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of cells.
But they also are known for their side effects <unk> in their most negative, because in the time that it is going to get to your hand -- they will be <unk> and worse in the time that it takes to get to its destiny, which is where it's more important, in HIV HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new blood cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life running through the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "You know, <unk> to get the treatment directly into the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use in <unk> for <unk> and surgery of diabetes -- they can be used for anything else -- including transportation <unk> of drugs.
In fact, we're now using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, that open up and closed almost immediately the infected cells with HIV to introduce drugs.
You can ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small laser beam on the bacterial cell membrane on HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will make a <unk> on the site.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head -- a <unk> that distributes the drug, releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to maintain the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you're successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV from the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every research researcher in our case, a <unk> treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups, not armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They do what these groups do when they're not shoot 'n.
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence from violence and study ways of encouraging violent participation to violent <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a <unk>
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but nobody sees it, what do they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the policies are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military system.
Similarly, Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking
They put a complex machinery of communication stations. stations. TV channels, Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here's the magazine magazine magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising <unk> but by working businesses -- for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> are also doing something else, create stronger ties to their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, put in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> are also trying to conquer the population of offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan was torn for war or even the beginning of <unk> <unk> can also be understood by the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a strong strong price price for the population.
But generally providing social services -- it means to fill a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory in 2006 from Palestinian Hamas can't be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex setting, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed and political groups participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and the more sophisticated these organizations are these organizations, less we can put it as something opposed to a state.
How to call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, running all its <unk> collect the trash, running the <unk> system.
It's a <unk>
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations with no state and hybrids and the more weak states are like in the Middle East and <unk> and they fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the developed tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to also establish and put the peace.
If we better understand the groups -- we will understand how much incentives to offer to foster violence from violence to not violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors will not <unk> the military power can win some <unk> but we will not give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety, to fill that food vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the label of <unk> it would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I would tell you as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then on interviews, people started calling me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and they would get sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women treat all over the world and anger, in particular, looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules -- who is asking too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe it's the same or a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, a feminist, and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same paycheck for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have right to use it easy and accessible to the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without <unk> <unk> or <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to get into account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and sexual condition, and so much more.
We have to figure out these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> ours is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear rap music -- <unk>
Even though the letter degrades women and <unk> I have a deep deep way, the classic <unk> <unk> of Yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical wish.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks, but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that make them happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, they accepted that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> conventional feminism who has bypassed or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, the workers, gay workers, gay women, <unk> and <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist feminist guy.
It also happens this: as a cartoonist.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we were hoping to make perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste of the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself to be <unk> before I try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> for fear of what that shows, fear of not being able to engage with the slightly realistic expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist photographer.
In the <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star embrace the feminism and to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time <unk> the cultural critics started endless if it was or not exactly feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of just believing the word of an adult and <unk> woman.
<unk> perfection <unk> because we're still struggling with a lot, we want a lot of <unk> we need so <unk>
We're going to go much beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until it's nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, the more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We go from recognizing our <unk> to give it to action and be a little more <unk>
If I hear music music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a blood supply.
These artists will not change their way of talking about women in their songs until they <unk> the change affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does this music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions make this makes it more difficult for women to make equality, equal equality that we all deserve and it's our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
They're two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
It's where you get away by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio aircraft when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when the movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, participate in your project, or working with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of <unk>
Those of us who are <unk> but they are going to engage in these kinds of projects, we can also be able to engage in these kinds of projects, we can also help them be even more likely to be able to overcome the barriers to the <unk>
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top of people in the power and film producers and music and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell it with courage -- good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, above all, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A few kids told me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't bother to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I had a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of the women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
And through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is about telling us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to get anything.
And in the other, I have a <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little brave when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had been <unk> because I visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with an immune immune system is one of the most easily diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this from over half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that broke the argument on autism and vaccines that would have been able to have a stable fraud for the British Medical Medical School.
It doesn't believe most scientists who have theory that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children with autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the <unk> of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very bizarre disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard of her -- they create their own professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued stable only three or four children per capita.
But then, in the 1990s started <unk>
<unk> in fundraising <unk> like <unk> <unk> they refer to autism as an epidemic, as if I could use it from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control Center for Atlanta what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and "a better detection detection to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking at her face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow and slow progress from the science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told the story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a psychiatrist psychiatrist Leo <unk> <unk> Hospital <unk> at Johns Hopkins <unk> In <unk> <unk> published a paper that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds <unk> to people around them, even at their own parents.
They could do fun for hours by shaking their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey to panic by <unk> as when you don't put their favorite toy in your usual place without knowing it.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria criteria for the diagnostic diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy, is very common in autism.
One time he was <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 children to her office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of childhood loss caused by cold <unk>
These kids, he said, they've kept quite carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't get <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in your clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records he said, <unk> <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, stating things like the kids were just <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for the families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started to test <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were <unk> and <unk> and they had a profound autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed services, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend himself for the National Indian Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They did a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
He <unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find children in the community.
What you saw -- it was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse diverse and diverse.
Some kids could not speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit into nice frames and <unk> as <unk> said <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost by trying to make sense of your data.
How did nobody do not realize these children before?
But then I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the year at the next year of <unk> and then he <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no one translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he <unk> it for her.
The document provides an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music, and kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disabled disability for life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces over the course of all life.
Instead of dealing with children in their clinic as patients, with Asperger's -- and he called them their little teachers, and he took to help in the development of education that were especially suitable for them.
<unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that has been an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuous <unk> known in pop culture as a awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even until I mean, for success in science and art, a hint of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk> model.
These changes didn't fall on broken <unk>
<unk> when I was <unk> and Judith worked on each other, to reform these people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four prizes of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they introduced early clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her child.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a net effect, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as they were predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact that it went, so that it went, so what the people with autism and their families will finally save the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame the vaccines for the increase in the diagnosis. A simple, powerful story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the death center is that one of every 68 children in the United States are right in the spectrum, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving by the new medical advances -- we would have the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of global operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and suffers from a attention deficit to the details.
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still catching <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we go through an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste your brain.
Thank you.
