You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can describe it as a farmer, or with <unk> clothes, and nobody has ever chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an <unk> is usually something that fell into some place.
You just have to turn on the apple to see it like a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle school, in the middle of Ohio in the middle of Ohio where I was the weird age of class.
When I went to bleed every week in the bathroom, every week, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life in letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
He made it for secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations that were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone phone called the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults we never get to know.
You could <unk> to Ohio and please bring that man to that man who has already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to tell you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we were taking care of her family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman who wanted to <unk> as adult came to <unk> it became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed it was turned into a circle -- and that <unk> that I told you about was present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
And it needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> me around the water -- almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they get out of the glaciers or the <unk> and the ice barriers.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to <unk> and they hold on to the end, while others can't afford it, more and <unk> in a passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, in large as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> they melts, I'm breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As a iceberg, it releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if you were from the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are unique that they are not going to be and will not be able to exist again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of years.
And another part of the ice has more than 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I would like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's very unlikely to actually be able to witness a <unk> <unk>
Here they go.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, starts to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
It's about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to stay too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of it, you're not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome is linked to the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X X chromosome binds to the X X chromosome.
And both <unk> and it starts life.
We will go back to talk about them later.
In my activity to be <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people are going to engage the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how the body fluids have considered body fluids -- what have you thought about the body.
The other role in my work is an activist, as <unk> of patients, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working with <unk> twins, two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sexual <unk> individuals whose physical typology is not fit in male and female <unk>
In <unk> we can <unk> <unk>
The <unk> embraces many different forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that is not <unk> in the common common forms of a male <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which gene <unk> the chromosome <unk> and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that we all have in the <unk> life.
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks receptors of testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome to <unk>
So, there are high testosterone levels, but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops in a course typically <unk>
When I <unk> the baby has a little bit of a little girl.
It's a young girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast -- but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is going on.
After giving them tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, like men, have in the body something called areolar <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a woman who doesn't know his structure, and I think it's going to be a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman who was born with testicles that have the <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated complicated thing, it's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some ways they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a <unk> <unk> born and raised and raised as <unk> had girlfriend and sexual relationships with her, carried a life as a kid and had just figured out that he had <unk> and a <unk>
It had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had 20th chromosomes and in the uterus -- the areolar glands were so active that we essentially create a hormone hormone environment.
As a consequence, his genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a <unk> case.
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> -- they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are lots of sex.
The reason why children with this kind of bodies -- that are <unk> twins, or <unk> or <unk> -- <unk> surgery is not to be able to enjoy a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason the reason that they went to several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is typically based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings to us a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have a <unk> identity -- it means having African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children who are born as two people inside a body.
The most high place is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put in the fabric of judgment for sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What a test are going to do to determine whether <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you to the journalists that have no test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't traces a <unk> line between men and women and women and <unk> and women and <unk> and <unk> are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more the science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought of these categories -- stable categories that are happening directly by <unk> <unk> <unk> are much more <unk> than they would <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, which is a lot more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimps.
What do we <unk> in the fact of <unk> in just a few <unk>
And as we put in science in the science we get more and more in a very awkward area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very important discussions today in the audience today -- not in public, but within the <unk> about when someone is considered died.
Our ancestors never had to do with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of his nose and if he was still not going to do it.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the dilemma of determine and this is actually puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories might be helpful to someone like me.
In politics I am progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it gets nervous.
And so that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about what was we thought of.
<unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent one of the Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every little watching that <unk> music, and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
Parents <unk> -- for me, the first activists of the anatomy and I explain to them why.
And what they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and it was <unk> with another which was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as everyone remember, what our Parents <unk> was the idea of the <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that was coming into the political power of blood being passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, and so on.
Parents <unk> rejected that idea and replacing it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game of play and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the differences, but that was very radical.
And they were in part of it, because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time -- to make science.
And there's very clear, if you look at the story of the Parents <unk> that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> <unk> is going to be a <unk> of a <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a consequence we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future of Human Rights movement.
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened in years next?
And women are <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement came to people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement by saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people who are going to lead to <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we need to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human <unk>
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> to anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five year-old children should have to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and I think we should <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before we had been June 1 months before I had been <unk>
Henry, on the contrary, was born in term, was born last March in 1980.
For the only fact that he was born three months before Mary was attributed to all three months before Henry -- three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being considered to be <unk> from the Princess of the Princess that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary, on his hand, does not have the same rights rights that Henry in every states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories -- which in several ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that the science went down so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of the anatomy themselves.
I don't want to give the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like science will become <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some time has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have a chromosome and you have to marry a woman you have to have the Y chromosome.
Now, in practice, they don't make tests of people who are <unk>
But this is also very strange for the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> <unk>
If we looked at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty <unk>
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we had to focus on this to make rights to people, because I will admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and smart decisions about their sexual relationships than people from 40 to know.
So how do you put the issue of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We really want to get that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to continue to lead this current thinking to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we will do a good job in the future.
We don't live in, for example, in a context as the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they're willing to be <unk> to a change of sex, in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple years ago that he had done to give birth twin twins to then pick them up, and then they cut his <unk>
But when the phone asked her the operation was a very <unk> operation -- responded to me that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, he has considered political <unk> rather than <unk> separation rather than <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who are not <unk> to change the end of the state.
So I think we have to be the head.
Well, to finish up, I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and it's that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking in a group.
Since years ago, since I have been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the sex difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and working in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> inside of the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was at school, one of my consultants who knew that I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered a feminist, like <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of the stereotypes.
But the more I have thought about his question, more I've seemed to be <unk> in <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if I know them, they were very excited to find the way to protect people in the state of the state, it's possible that there is more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we engage democracy beyond the <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where you want to go live and work, I have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than its building cost.
So we could easily get to the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just went through the buildings of apartments.
Imagine half of those who wanted to live in apartments were owners, and that the other half is still not worth it.
You might try to increase the ability to do <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround the surrounding have rules to avoid the same and the distractions in the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a completely new place, building a completely new apartment building, always and when the standards of that place will be built in construction instead of putting it out.
So I proposed that governments are going to bring new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75 <unk> would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the following election in the following election -- <unk> <unk> became <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms and the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> that was his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and connect all the current residents of apartments.
And so much attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually they are the rules that get us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent a link to the <unk>
I showed you to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we came together in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than its cost will be.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> terrain that in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and said that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is about 100 kilometers square.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that you measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 <unk>
All the world's <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of the Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I'm here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need to benefit from <unk> countries that could benefit from the countries that help them set up and make the rules of the <unk> so that everyone could trust that <unk> actually become <unk>
We went and we saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could easily be about a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All of them are all <unk> in society, <unk>
To <unk> in the constitution, it has to pass twice in Congress.
The 17 of February passed again in another voting <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting in the age of 21 to February, a delegation of 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new <unk> center of the city that's building in Korea -- is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the administrators to <unk> and then they would allow the administrators to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Supreme Court to be the last end for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners in cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know they've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go to work work, sometimes they're unwed mothers who have to earn money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even children are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What do you think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my <unk> friends asked me to say, "Thank you TED TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession to public <unk> and it's that, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently, to photograph and publish in my blog suits, colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from second hand of <unk> markets and <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second <unk> allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be my size?
<unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was talking about, for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings them to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought I'd be able to find everything else that I would want to use to get here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks at TED in <unk>  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothes.
Let's start with the Sunday.
This is what I call this tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see it for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> it was <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a glowing red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get away from the right people, not just let you get <unk>
<unk> <unk> the child that you carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play <unk> or I remember her little age seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't do well with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain that in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inside and outside, you don't see you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a single and unique style of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've been tested again and again when people were approaching me this week, just because of what was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I go home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave some of the things.
I don't need <unk> emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I am.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of them <unk> for one of these extreme ones, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, who just like most of the other quantum physical physicists, we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put it to play with them and then we see how <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in a place at the time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I did not do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet the game with that parking bar showed him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things will not allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars with these strange little particles.
And when they play with the particles, they discover that they do all kinds of weird things -- as you can go through walls, or you can go through walls, or you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe those small particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because they don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But I didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it should not be following the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it doesn't have been.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object is also still the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip here.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. You find it right at the center.
And then here we make a big focus on the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of a little metal little bit of a springboard and a springboard -- and that <unk> <unk>
And then I did this almost as a computer chip to do this.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of swimming <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but it needs some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be in a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people will go up with doing those things, because I don't want to get it to them, or, in fact, <unk>
quantum mechanics is that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of <unk> objects are not just people, it's the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to put it all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
They put the lights up, then you put a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then you put it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute <unk>
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure its movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way it <unk> was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a smooth machine, we could make it <unk> and that doesn't go back at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of the trillion atoms that make that metal piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
He wants to say that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which is that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that little metal piece is more or less the same as the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you just too?
I mean, it's my logic that I talk about.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And this is when we got it, and we turned into the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are. And that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And it was 18 months ago, I made another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss, which was here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they went through it with 17 very interesting museums than nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did it.
I think my own story is just explained to this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
So better than showing you the demo for then to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done since this launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery gallery -- the <unk> -- the <unk> -- Van <unk>
I'm actually going to get into one of my favorite <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click on and <unk> we're inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the room.
We're still going forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign show.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click out here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call technology <unk>
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million the pixel up.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you actually get with 10,000 million the pixel up.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have the price.
But if you really want to get <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I went on and discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick with a stick on Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further into and see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the image, so you'll see really what it is.
Here is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're quickly going to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see what Van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It increases it and truth that we did.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night, I think I'd never seen it so before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have any time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same way.
You can come online to create their own museum from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walked inside, and I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and maintain a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes justice to its work and it's represented properly online.
And the big question that you do today is you have this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I have something to show you.
Think of this is a <unk>
In our lab we call this design design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am Italian, all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something really interesting in the operating <unk> one in the last two decades.
Now sometime ago, if you wanted to earn a career from Formula 1, take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what in engineering, you have a control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming <unk>
And as <unk> they're starting to respond in a different way and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities are big.
As I note aside I wanted to mention that cities are just two percent of the Earth's cortex but represent 50 percent of the population of the population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for a year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
And in a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms were coming out of sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo, <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo, <unk> <unk> the <unk> says that at the end, I took the hammer and he threw it to the Moses -- you can still see a little bit of a <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> <unk> -- and he said, <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a little bit of <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment, and the way it will happen.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer hopefully in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by watching activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The time line is on the top.
At the late early there are people here and there doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a fast phone call.
Second <unk> End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
Raise Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big <unk>
The next day everyone went to the center of the winner and the first minister of then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time -- people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the structure of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac, how it would be <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that were all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, a label on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist.
They're going on complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we dropped not away, it's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we dropped a day still still there.
And if we show it to people, then we can be able to promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at first, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water in public spaces in public spaces.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, come to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was created as a <unk> <unk> with water.
If you fall the pixels can be written in them, I'll show patterns, images texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We introduced this to Mayor <unk>
He liked it.
<unk> a commission to design the building at <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors no windows, but when you come up to it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there is a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, somebody who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture goes down.
Here it works.
You see people <unk> so it goes inside.
And here I am myself trying to not try to prove the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open up to let you happen, but a building that was still making cuts and holes in water and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of water, and of projections over them.
And this is what led us to thinking about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have small helicopters on the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which moves with others in sync.
We could form this cloud,
It's a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, what it changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, and different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a pixels of pixels in 3D that you can get close, and you can see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them <unk>
We can have each pixel with a entrance that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of reading today, the star of the New York City <unk> to capture its movements in 3D and use them as input to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> you see it in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> 3D <unk> as it capture.
It can make all the movement.
You can walk around the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could involve people to do something and change our environment -- as an oyster nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of them <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we go from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama Obama Obama -- we can go through the digital world of the power world, from the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how do you move from digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together in the collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixel up.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in the pixel <unk>
You can move around, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to share the major moments of the London Olympics and even more, and can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I would tell you that, with just a lot of changes in your genes, they could improve <unk> for a more accurate, and faster.
Or maybe you might like to be in better ways, to be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure for ourselves?
What about living with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most thing that you can tell you.
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people will do creativity?
Raise your hand.
<unk> should probably be the number of creative people.
That's very good.
How many would <unk> <unk>
A number more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something like this, the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe this is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference.
The great fan of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Catholic Church, <unk> wrote an essay titled "Nothing in biology makes sense of <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is, of course, the most interest we do.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
In the middle there have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same fluorescent protein, which comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have in the intestine more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> you ask them about the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, arid is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to have no effort for your part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of a hurry <unk>
But, for that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe <unk> the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe -- life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and unique life, and human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I was just <unk> I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental about the existence of the existence of life, in organisms -- every cell just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two <unk> cells.
But when organisms appear -- things start to change.
It goes into the scene of sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one might say that the <unk> of the body is going into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> death on <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every year I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas right in their 90s, in their 90s, right in their late Vegas today.
And one night someone hits his door to the hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a wonderful <unk> of clothes.
He looks at him, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He says, George, I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the <unk> goal not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
He wanted us to give us healthy.
I wanted to reclaim health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is to move the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are kind of <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think that all of the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily engage longevity.
They don't necessarily engage the biggest or the strongest or the smartest thing and even the smartest one.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish in a vacuum, yet they've managed to make that an environment <unk>
So what does this mean? When we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward at the stage, I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and separated from the population.
And second of all, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we are going to make it so much that it's no longer possible to have the necessary isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is that there is an evolution of traditional kind, natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll it slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> as a <unk> species, they're going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce the evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing possibility and terrifying possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we carry.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we do this?
First of all, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what is choosing at the individual and family level.
Think about it, if you could be able to be able to choose not just sex from their <unk> but in your own body to make genetic apples to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to do those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and he sued 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near for 20,000 and a week.
Not much to make the human genome for <unk> and be more and closer to all of us.
They come from those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us but that they're going to be <unk> against other viruses.
There is no experimental experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine with the flu flu in cells from a mushroom plant.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is increasingly possible.
Imagine then only other two <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells in their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthier life opportunity to remove the diabetes, to remove the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases also to allow us to also take <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could relate to the next generation of the vending machine.
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of moving this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that could normally take 100,000 years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better society, more successful <unk>
Or, let's choose a different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we are going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what you could do it, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 3,000 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds scary.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight.
So immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The <unk> pilot is the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
We get the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and not <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more <unk> words have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with a flight <unk>
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a moment.
We have this list of things to do before they die, and I thought about all the people I wanted to do in life, and I thought about all the fences that I wanted to come and I didn't do it, all the experiences that I wanted to have and never have been <unk>
As I thought about that later. I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the guy is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and with my mistakes I tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, also gives up my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that we were thinking about things that don't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels about <unk>
I don't try to have the reason why I don't try to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, it will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, "I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a little boy.
And for me, that was all reason to be the world.
At that point I realized that the two points -- that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You know, you're flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- because it's not like -- but imagine, and how do you look like?
What do you expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are being the best parents who were <unk>
Thank you.
I clearly have been <unk> in the life with a lot of robotic projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk>
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so obviously, the graffiti is a kind of intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to take <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that I have seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're an important person and have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate in that way that they can do with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I was obsessed with her brother and his father there at that precise moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make your art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has both in your inner can't be able to <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research, Research <unk> that have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser laser, you draw over that and record negative space.
So you go out there making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a cycle of life.
They start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the <unk> to Bush and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, a lot of organization and a lot of organization and a lot of moving things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of insurance companies, and we got a machine that you could put together -- a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to you with the guy getting an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers out of the whole world of all of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved into the back garage and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were born, they would have taken out the walls of the walls and his place would have been <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> journey my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> <unk> that we bought on the shipping of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a camera -- the <unk> we put it on an LED light and now there's a device that is free -- and there's a device that is free -- we published the code, the software is low in free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company that says it.
There is no hospital that I can say.
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we come back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the other room, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of planning, in all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see it.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot of the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was reflected in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and I would take me out of there so that I could be able to <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to walk around with this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserve much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it, and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money on this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the most best inventions in 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up close the <unk> is that in April this year in the <unk> of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that doesn't possible, make it possible.
None of what there was in this room was possible -- the <unk> scenario, the computer, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I have never done anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we are going to find something that we feel like to do, if it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in very difficult situations and at the same time such a dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked on a <unk> mine.
It's hard and dangerous.
And it spent 30 days a lot of fun in the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance, with the only objective of treat.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you don't have any idea about what it is and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But he said this, it's a very good opportunity to <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked me a year ago, it had not been able to do with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working, we looked at the marketing world.
And as I said earlier, I stood in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could tell me, nothing could be done for something so hard or as dangerous as you enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> So I want to make a film that I try to make a film <unk> and marketing and advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to be called "The largest <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything above the top at the bottom, it has images of brand, all the time from the <unk> which appears before the title, the X-ray brand.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> to the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more for <unk>
It was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of the X brand in the title but we're going to make sure we put all the categories that we could in the film.
You may have a shoe, and you get the most cool shoe you have <unk>
The most great car that you've driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink that you have <unk> <unk> from "The largest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and we actually show the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You'll see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole idea -- all the shot at beginning to end.
And I would love to help us make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because this is the first time I hear that that's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half a half -- <unk> <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth to convince a couple of big results.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the film is going to happen to us as a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be you.
MS: But it's going to be hard for the film to be <unk>
JK: Both things.
MS: And it means you're not very optimistic.
So, I got my help. I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought that <unk> the <unk> meant we have a <unk>
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these sudden companies disappeared.
No one wanted to do with this film.
I really surprised me.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people saw it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of separate media, is not the idea to count that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this picture.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>      -- this is one of the first images that appeared.
I like your <unk> <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or easily <unk> or easily <unk> or easily <unk> it is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices -- being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even <unk> the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it reality, something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
It was a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want to do this story -- <unk> history.
We want to make it a story, but we want to make it <unk> <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would tell me in some lie -- and there he is looking at me as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in the story.
It's your story, it's my story, and there's <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to remove the <unk> and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to think about -- and that I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking with the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who do big, giant movies, and others who make films small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make movies of big <unk> they say that the reason their movies are so successful is due to the brands that they have.
And then my friends who do independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest <unk>
How are we going to see <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone with someone I can say you're good good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want you to help you get to <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as well as a solid, solid, <unk> to <unk> on bar, whatever.
That's the overall look.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> the kind of small movies that <unk> are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people is the reason that we are interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: Right.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something audacious, cool.
I think that <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep ourselves cool over time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the street of the street, to people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do they define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: Woman: The '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> brand.
<unk> Something unique. <unk> Man: And I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray and things like that.
Usually I carry it out like sunglasses, or the <unk> and the same thing.
Woman: If Dan was a brand <unk> it could be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: Man 2: I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of a <unk> part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the guy in the pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: So my brand is FedEx because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> failed.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be brand Tom, but often I'm going to tell you at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: I think a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These are different people, my way to see the world.
AT: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you <unk> as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case where they start and start in my family, in West Virginia.
AT: What's the next thing you want to talk about here?
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
AT: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
AT: Tell me about the <unk> for what does that happen?
What's the <unk> What phase is you find now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
So a little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be scared, where are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.
A: thank you for your patience -- <unk> Great <unk> Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but <unk> in your personality of <unk> the Morgan Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They get very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's the <unk> nature of avoiding the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually make them <unk> and make them become a positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classical Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come -- but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to take your brand, your brand, your brand, which would be?
You're a <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful being driven by being cool like <unk> contemporary or audacious or bold <unk> like <unk> <unk> fast or <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical <unk>
Or are you rather <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You're -- traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we came to tell the story in this movie of how the resonance in order to identify the <unk> centers in the brain so much for a movie marketing for film.
We went to San Paulo to San Paulo where the advertising appeal to the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts that companies are going on in schools with the problems of money in the U.S.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer or the ones that I've been more successful is those in which I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did he gone? They had success?
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> or press, TV or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all of the agencies we talk about, they will tell their customers not to be part.
I've always believed that if you get risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you take the people out of that are pushing it to failure.
I think that when you train their employees at the risk of the risk is preparing their entire company to reward them for <unk>
I feel that what is going to happen to advance is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to be not afraid of the opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, to go, I think we have to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Now more than not a little bit of honesty is going to travel a long way.
And he said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk -- <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: I mean, <unk> in the name of transparency, that happened with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the TED, the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my assistance for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes are not using <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash virus by Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, and then we're ready.
This is the <unk> plan.
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> enters the gray box, hurt the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they spent very strange.
<unk> was <unk> as a laboratory rat that didn't like our <unk> and the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And then from experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at in the gray box, if you find a specific configuration and even if the program that is trying to infect it is actually working on that <unk>
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant.
better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the <unk> code, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed armed by people that obviously had all the internal information.
I would get all the points to attack.
They probably even know how much to <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, let me tell them, the load is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we tried to engage them with the real world, with potential of the real world.
We need theories about them that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals -- we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I told them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
So rotor is that piece of mobile inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the digital digital <unk> looking at the data and its structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't afford it.
I started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall has <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A kind of <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
And so it wasn't like this.
The results have been that after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to get back to begin.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would happen to one and itself, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, I really <unk>
That's the grey box, and you see the <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the input values of sensors for example, of blood sensors and the sensors of vibration and provides <unk> code, which still runs during the attack -- with false data.
And believe it or not, these <unk> data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the large steam turbine goes from speed, they have to open escape valves.
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can <unk>
And we don't have the <unk> and the security system, the <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> of <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a car plant.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, and we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms for <unk>
It will be used as possible.
And if you made that -- with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to face the implications, and better than we start making now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main thing behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower here.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, thankfully <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give <unk> skills or other than making users of wheels come up and get a walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that goes in the morning, gives you a big force, which is also increases your speed, and help, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate and connected it to the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back to a 45 pounds, load of it, and it is <unk> getting even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications to injury on the back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human Rights
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can <unk> 90 pounds of terrain for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back now to the users of wheels, on what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, on <unk> chairs around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with a very young people, with the damage column that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- <unk> against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is growing up very quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been over the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who had an injury in the <unk> column and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It was completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to the computer computer, here on the back.
There is some batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and at the knees, and make it going on with this soft and very natural ride.
AB: I had 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing it costs down <unk>
In a fraction of two, I lost all feeling and all movement from <unk>
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So he stole me to the last hint of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs down the rock and even riding on the <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change future generations -- not just from soldiers, but to Amanda, to all the users of wheels, to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know your cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos from forests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest relatives.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this in our narratives in our human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society, where violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the big apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest and it's been very hard to <unk>
The Congo is an extraordinary land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been prolonged for decades and caused almost so many deaths like the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts the survival of <unk>
The trade of hunting meat and deforestation does not fill in or a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the apes -- the love, the <unk> not <unk> because they have <unk> sex and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
As humans, as humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish links and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
<unk> increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you see the game Bonobo sees the roots <unk> the same <unk> the dance and the dance and humans.
The game is the glue that we are.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
Could it be the origin of the phrase, "I have a <unk> of <unk>
I just think that in this case he love, right?
Yeah.
So the sex game is both common in bonobos as humans.
And this video really is interesting because we are able to get this video really interesting because we can see this video of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust and promotes the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> can take a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with the water <unk>
I think, as it is, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that the Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But do we get the maximum our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans for the same, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems less appropriate to play, they can be the most <unk>
So by that, fellow primates, to accept this gift of evolution and play together as they will, the creativity, the friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a volunteer body.
And in our city, where the volunteers will disseminate a highly qualified staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high chance to go.
But there was a race to foot against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our task is.
When I found the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that has no doubt on one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full at night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before I am, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain and he asked him to go and save the dog owner.
The <unk> I was <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I walked into a building in <unk> to save a live being alive just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go back to the house.
I need to <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brought this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firefighters that at that height more or less had ended up the fire and walked into the main room for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden back to the ladder where I met my <unk> and the precious dog in the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures for the house owner where, as I had to expect, his treasure. got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the owner of <unk> <unk> for the brave effort to be able to save her house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that someone had ever reached a couple of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as voluntary firefighter -- I witnessed acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of the collective acts of the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have done, or are to be doing -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you about this: Not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you know, <unk> now.
They put food in a dining room, <unk> a park park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they walked into the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem to be strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea of concrete modules that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, we came up with this.
He called the brick of assembly <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they have made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, the same year in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> <unk> world piled on other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block of concrete, the transistor allows to create circuits much larger and more complex, a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are quiet to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, and sound, and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're linked by magnets together.
So you can't put in the wrong way.
<unk> have a code of color.
The green is the road, the blue is the stream, the pink and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to put together a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.
A blue one with a green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or more slow, just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to look at bricks and ready to use.
<unk> <unk> solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a night works, or why the door of an elevator gets open or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronics in electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  So a few weeks ago, we took <unk> the designers at the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island who have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper, and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> canyon as a movement.
But hang on, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that has fear of darkness.
For these no engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to look at all.
So <unk> has open source source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is seeking to engage with the environment in focusing on the environment.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to keep the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, <unk>
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that they are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like some <unk> Peace <unk>
<unk> some members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of the Third World We send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
<unk> <unk>
This is a flood of the city in Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody will clean up when it is caught by the snow because he knows it's not very good by running fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for the help of this <unk>
Last year in Boston had a team of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time, it was very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You have to focus on when you <unk>
When you do that, you put it a name, in this case he got <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a component ballet.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology of government <unk>
And it extends down viral.
A responsible for systems of the city of <unk> to see this app realized that I could use it, not for snow, but for the citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk> the batteries.
That's why the citizens <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to get people to stay up to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know nine cities that are going to use using it.
And this has been spread without a organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology you know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done by normal channels that would have taken at least two years ago, about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in criminal power in California that the moment has spent 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that program is a couple of days and it spreads in viral form, is a kind of a shot of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the best way to work, not as in private companies, as a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
That is, without <unk> in the open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way that it represents the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we can engage together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They have not given up with government.
Do you feel a great frustration in front of that, but they didn't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that they put us crazy, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because alone doesn't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to <unk> because things are changing.
Politics don't <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately made of us -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way of producing change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to be <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the center of phone care center and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you make a <unk> brand in the United States.
Scott <unk> This phone call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and make music hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a center of calls.
It's got a web and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
We don't get that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New <unk> <unk> in Boston.
One day, this happened actually comes this <unk> <unk> in my garbage cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make it <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report would say, "I went to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went around the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical ones.
And this is also a great example of the income of government to collaboration <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological <unk>
I'm talking about a platform for people to get sick and help others.
So a citizen helped another one, but here's the government had an key role.
It connected the two people.
And it could have connected with government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps another, we would save the communities.
If we call animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but you think you're the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political <unk> We sometimes spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will build our values and understand our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the <unk> <unk>
So underneath it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But this is that <unk> which keeps us that that we financed as something that is operating in our against, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work that we have to make bureaucracy the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizen citizens who have written a very detailed report from 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism is activism <unk>
And for those of us who have come up with the government, is time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
We have to see the enormous challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do with government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the rule of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act -- just to articulate the systems of the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years so I am, to <unk> I'm a generation older than a lot of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who are going to <unk> they're all going to talk.
They can express your views at any channel at the same time and they do.
That's why the government problem doesn't care about their voices.
They're using your hands.
They set out the work to program apps that make the government work better.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking <unk> <unk> a garbage bucket that has a <unk>
Of course, we could always have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, not just consumers of government that pay taxes, and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all of us together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons.
I've spent most of my life in the communities in the world in <unk> and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I will be here at TED looking and hearing about these stimulus -- has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that say here have impact on all the world.
Instead, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher may have a lot of sense, but if you teach feeling that you can have a special meaning of it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the rule of law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard to be strong, I had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at it, she was approaching me and I was getting a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then let me angry.
One or two hours later, I would come back to me and say, <unk> still feel my <unk>
And if I was saying no, I would give me again and if he said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always want to be near it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to get your time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight -- nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all of my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I first thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him, and she said, but she was very serious.
After 15 to 20 minutes, she got up, went up in the room, and he said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "I just want you to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "I first I want you to tell me, is that you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that they always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said, "I second that I want you to tell me, is that you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is going to be.
I thought I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field, in Southern <unk> I have a brother older and sister a small year.
When I was 14 or 15, a day my brother came home with a six <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got out of the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> I mean, you know, you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister also.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What happens to you? Take a <unk>
I came up with force and <unk> "Oh, not be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really don't make sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother was naturally believed that all his grandchildren was special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the <unk>
My uncles died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that we had to do with it, we had to <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there was 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> as certain despair, determined by these facts.
One of every three black men between the 18 and the 30 years is in jail or a parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore County, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in color are in jail or a parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a criminal system that is much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is affecting the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not our problems.
We are <unk>
It seems to me.
We're looking at our work with some good developments curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well in other states, you give you the rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years the loss of loss of rights will be as high as it was before they were born, the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where you have been sentencing to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, without a possibility of going back.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They were teaching people at the death row
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one that is innocent who is <unk> and released from the death <unk>
A rate of mistake, <unk> an innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never allow you to fly airplanes if every nine that <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
We don't know a lot of this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a bit defined by terror.
In many communities, people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell the people who stop saying that in our history -- for the first time with terrorism.
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was, obviously, with <unk> and decades of racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we would go with each other.
We are constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome the racial community without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's good worrying to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death row in Germany.
We can never have it here."
The room stayed silently and a lady said, "There's no way with our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> we were going to run <unk>
So let's think about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't get it out.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we really don't care about these issues, the positive things and the wonderful things they are, though, though, that we are <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But recently, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> the <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate two things.
lately lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more commitment to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who will never get to TED.
Think about them it is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual,
With innovation, the development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that come from <unk>
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much on the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no more disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly humans if we don't pay for due enough attention to poverty, to <unk> by injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity that if we ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together, just to speak.
Occasionally, lady -- I called me to say to me, <unk> comes out of the <unk>
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. Be lady.
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you're going to <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks turned to me and said, "Now, <unk> me tell me that it's that idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give you my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to help those who have been doomed to do.
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences for life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and at the end he looked at me and said, "The <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally the humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone is taking something that doesn't blame you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
And so I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> it doesn't judge us for our technology, because of our designs, or for our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat rich and powerful and <unk> but as they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make a lot of force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years that have been <unk> so that they were taught as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge just turn someone into what is not it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night too late was awake -- my God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> <unk> has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14 year-old client -- black <unk> black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my family in 14 years is treated as a privileged white <unk> of a <unk>
In <unk> I put that there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the government of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical issue, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, I was not only <unk> but I had sent it to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> oh God, I have to go through this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into court.
I thought this would be very hard and <unk>
I finally came down the car. She walked into court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he looked at me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you. I said yes.
And then I walked up and <unk>
And I stood up in the ear,
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the ward of audiences.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Be me." And we started walking.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the guy who had written those <unk>
They got the cops <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people. And all I am, because we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye I was able to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would just look at the window and you would hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black <unk> with concern, I entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> showed up, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> became <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the operating room.
And the old black stood up, looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young man who keeps her sight in the objective with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we can't really be truly human, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
What our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity has to engage for <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, for those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the objective with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> you hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in the audience of doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to make the funding that you spend today in policy policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death penalty in the next five years.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of the rapes don't get anything.
Here's an opportunity to change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to be made to make the law <unk>
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you who believe it is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not crimes with violence.
It's for the evil War against drugs.
That's why this is a dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let ourselves convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the <unk> chain by stealing a bicycle by small crimes against property, rather than making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment doesn't do anything for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about here today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats for bin Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be in the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that the media means <unk> negative news, because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting a lot more data than the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to us more than survive, the first stop of all of those data is an old snippet of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and recorded all of the information looking for something in the environment that could hurt us.
That's why one of the stories of stories would look at the negative.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there's blood blood, it's very true.
And because all digital devices provide us, negative news, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be <unk>
But maybe not like that.
Maybe instead, what happens is we got <unk>
Perhaps huge progress in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction of the species, the shortage of water and <unk> and <unk>
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long time, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average income per capita adjusted for inflation has <unk>
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy passed from 25 to more than 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to see increasingly <unk>
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., a lot of the people who live under the poverty line are electricity, water, <unk> TV, mobile and air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the past century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It is a lot of technology -- and then it's increasing exponentially.
My great friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the phone that has in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time, in war and peace, in recession in <unk> and <unk>
It's the outcome of fast computers used to build a faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> on a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, the <unk> of Moore's Law, there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
<unk> in the cloud, my friends of <unk> call an infinite computation -- sensors and networks, 3D printing and will distribute personalized production on all the planet, synthetic biology, fuel artists, vaccines and food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" Watson, <unk>
It was <unk>
I was looking for the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been <unk>
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think of creating abundance, it doesn't mean creating life <unk> for each <unk> to create a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the kind of the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops had covered with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of Washington is by aluminum <unk>
You see, although the aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth's mass, it doesn't come as a <unk>
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he did the aluminum thing that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy for the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that's about 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 percent of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not a matter but it is <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that it shows that the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager spacecraft pointed to the Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
So I was a very famous photo, how do you get <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent of the ice is ice, and we <unk> for the water <unk> of the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology that's available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes to nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission for <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small ride.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any <unk> saltwater, water <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that I'll make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full trust that would be, Coca-Cola <unk> in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an extraordinary innovation for this technology that we have today.
And we've seen it on cell phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile penetration in the developing world in the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smart smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance and communications that nobody could have predicted ever.
better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video and music, electronic diagnosis technology -- now <unk> and losing market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing gets to get to the health of your health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the teams of the world so that we get these technologies into a mobile device with which they talk about, and because they have <unk> you can get blood out of your finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the load of <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers.
When this <unk> device -- a virus of RNA or DNA that will not be able to call the <unk> and first of all, avoid the pandemic.
But this is the highest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just just pass the brand of the seven billion billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do? What would you get?
And instead of economic collapse we have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy Khan and because of using impressions in 3D, and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three million more members of mankind, healthy polite and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give the parenting wherever they are, a voice to be heard and power for the first time?
What do these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions we can't afford to.
Something that I learned with the X Prize is that small equipment, guided by their passion with a goal, of course, they can do things that before they could only do big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up with a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and find out how the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played this with a college teachers among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people walked together and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we are focused on to work on the solution of big challenges, and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very strong idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And it described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, over the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come into the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they are still <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, about <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 degrees, the black beard <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so he became more than half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the number of fish had fallen down in half.
I went to five centimeters.
It was a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
Anyway, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit at the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was meant to impose into the countries that had been 100,000 dollars -- <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly, he called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish on it, and we did studies in the South Sea of China <unk> and, especially in the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured was a little bit <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are on the bottom.
And most of the fish are blobs of tiny blobs of <unk> remains that are <unk>
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
It was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain mountain is what the fishermen are collected every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember.
They put the starting point on the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you put this happens something like this.
On the x-axis, we have things that have biodiversity, biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation to use the <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life like normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss of loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end of the way to keep some <unk> <unk>
And that, in large measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when <unk> societies kill animals without knowing what has done until about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in an ocean synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
At the time there are a few fish, but we thought that is the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence was presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as I captain such as captain might be able to look at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or, usually they don't use the scientists in the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't rely on sources of the past.
That's the huge paper that can be able to fulfill a protected area.
Because with marine protected areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and is extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a marine marine zone, and you can benefit from the vision that you can erase what you <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Middle west, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time there was gray whales on the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why do we <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to Cameron <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why videos are making viral and what importance does that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can get <unk> on the Internet in a <unk>
You get over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of viral gets a number of visits and it wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: I creators of trends, communities and create surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park, of <unk>
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views at the rise of popularity last summer.
<unk> didn't say to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I was talking to the <unk>
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> presented us and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   You all want to go on the end of week, the weekend.    <unk> Friday. <unk> on Friday.  KA: Don't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Rebecca is one of the most popular videos in the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed seemed to have emerged from nowhere.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people in doing a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of trends are taking a view of view, and they share it with a broader public, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this great inner joke then begin to talk about that and do things.
And now there's 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation.
That's it, that's it.
This year saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird to know that there is a three hours version of the time you've seen four million times.
Until the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up among the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did a version of the old one.
And then it did international <unk>
Suddenly we came up with a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we all can form in.
Because today it's not just <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or entitled the Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might I have written this situation?
In a world where two days of video goes up minute, just the very unique and unexpected thing can be <unk> so that these things have done.
When a friend told me I had to see this great video of a guy who protest <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't have interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by not circular for the <unk> but there are often obstacles that prevent you circulate for the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise of the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> I got that five million saw and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth everything that we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The trend trend creators creative communities, of participation, totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- which we all have access and is the audience that defines popularity
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, <unk> <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't <unk> permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media features -- it's just the current media -- but we would have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unity and freedom of their country.
<unk> while <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been completely in vain.
The words, for so much time friends, are I going to do it.
They become silent.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to do it, but it <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> in the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been meant to be a <unk> task for her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And then from a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat was summed up into the hot Ocean <unk>
Every adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the children, the rape and death.
As most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> <unk>
If we were <unk> we first took it to my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon, and empty and empty space.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to pick up for six hours.
But I remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I finish the journey was too much to get it, and the first apple I tried, because of the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
And after three months in a refugee camp, it was in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women in three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> whose population is <unk>
Unlike the middle class of middle class whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of right.
<unk> that came from the shops were from the rest of the world.
And the 20th English fragments of the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, and then on a <unk> assembly line, working six days twice to go.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and so an extra <unk> in English and <unk> wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> which was usually <unk>
Two middle pairs for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were weird <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back again.
house, where?
Something is <unk>
It was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we would tell us about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be up until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer shop, then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the intense, angry and <unk> boys that were trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in green worlds.
In one, I was a classic <unk> student with what I was talking about myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically, by violence, abuse of drugs and <unk>
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of school, they elected the young Australian woman.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to another, but its edges don't <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk to sites that I had never heard of, and in homes whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire in <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age that she had when she got into the boat.
He had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What do you be not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly, I was talking about it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all of the roads in life, many of them doing what we would live on the boundary of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
It had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown one, new on the scene -- and not only is it right, but it's something that is being grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the <unk> of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, a optimism mix -- a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
I would take a small group of people who are not <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I would make a giant <unk> pot that all <unk>
<unk> at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, and some bright, and we open up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before you end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of her husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to take the cause her, and much more <unk> caused when I won it.
The can't do proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room in <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple.
We tell the stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
He asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
They haven't <unk>
If there is a nerve in our family, that runs through the women.
Given who we were and how life built us now to us, we can now see that the men that have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The obsession would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might want to do that for you?
But I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy right.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, a brave of each wave, the constant rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see them a safe I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the American singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
And then when you went to the great Prince warrior Indian, I had <unk> I took a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, I got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that blew me up.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic to allow magic to do not <unk>
My grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was for me the most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had a sense that the mobile and the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent you to <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books since the age of 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers from the entire world.
You can know how we take the book, you know.
Where we are.
I put the text on the image, the animation, and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that happen?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back a picture of the book.
At several moments, you get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live alive thanks to GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner girl gets excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that very magic of childhood, those ideas that we were <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always turned to me exciting.
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to release the fireflies.
And actually, they light up your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole galaxy will be in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I moved into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book there has always been maps but have been static.
This is a map that goes up -- <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book are also <unk>
Now I'm going to get in.
Another very important aspect of me is to create Indian content and a contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old <unk>
That's why we're bringing it back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that is current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with its technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images from different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this <unk> ritual you have to go out and, in a chapter, we would take a picture to a flower and then you get <unk>
In another chapter, we have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
In this way, you create a digital collection of photos that you can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that have been taking.
Inside the variants of connection between the magic -- the Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book we asked you to have an interaction on which one comes out with the iPad and video on and through <unk> it sees a group of <unk> <unk> that appear on inner plants in the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves with leaves there.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature are associated with technology and magic and technology come to each other.
It <unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic -- joy and love love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a sign of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail, we just stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale -- it's very simple.
It's got a <unk> and it goes down.
Every morning I got <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to 95 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him too. So he can see what's my problem of weight, not at the same time when I need assistance or <unk> or some urgency to that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have over four followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you get up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure for the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
So from the next week we will be available in the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to vote from their homes, take their blood pressure, to take their doctor, and share it with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, and they come back to recover the control and be ship to their own <unk> but also can help us care because of the challenges that we face as the firing of attention to care of care, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did would like to share it with you with a video.
We all have shipping controls in the <unk>
Maybe we have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> ATM <unk>
So where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find out chains of fast food.
But where is the closest we are, closest to help this patient?
Well, no one else <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saving lives right now.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public audience, you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they had already been introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use his cell phone phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I want to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to go globally to the world.
We're looking at all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find, work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> it can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
You might be services or <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that is shown is still in its place.
Please take care of this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they are photographs that can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first <unk> <unk>
I mixed with my previous passion, but it was a little bit different because when the camera was using the camera that was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk> is <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this: A construction in a very <unk> road.
But it has a <unk>
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful in the way, but with the common goal of keeping the <unk> level.
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want you to have been captured in a way as a photograph.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look real.
It's the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way, can create something that still seems like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's give the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture that they do is a realistic picture I think are those in which we don't even know the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining pictures it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect link.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the staff I think it's easier to create a place that would find a place that you find it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew that I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing ride.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a pit of stone.
And yes, I even made the house from the top of the island to make it more <unk>
So to achieve a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job by taking pictures the result can be very beautiful and very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general side.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power nets power.
The interesting thing about this is that this is like a lot of other things that we tend to see, is sort of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, each step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk> is a novel thing.
Here's something strange here.
And that's exactly going to talk about.
Please turn the lights out.
It was more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we make technology on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if the draw on a regular curve in which, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any of the technology that I want to give you the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation would go as fast as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development history that every few years will take orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- to look at these <unk> curves -- we see that they're not forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
We get one of two things.
Or you have to become a typical <unk> I know like this until something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what the world used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and I ask myself, is, what is that new way you adopt the world?
What new state is going to go to the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all that we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel like something is going on.
It's a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today makes any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition be that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computing technology.
Because I think the only way to understand that is taking distance and look at the long term.
The time scale I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about half a half billion years when the Earth was a great sterile rock with lots of chemicals that they <unk> around them.
If we look at the way those chemicals were organized we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there were floating around <unk> oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil <unk> had a particular combination of chemicals that they did to incorporate out of the outside of the outside, and the drops of them grew up grew up grew out of the outside of the outside of it.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those drops were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> they would take a distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
So each <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that in a way will become better at the time to incorporate the chemical <unk> more <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a very simple form of life, a very simple life, but things get really interesting when these drops the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemist called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution of writing that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The incredible thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved 2.5 billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living thing is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have a hundred <unk> of white dust that I'm trying to hide the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this fragment of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread in the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy about another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things are going to be very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information to form the cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to the communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and we set up a <unk>
In that way, <unk> or <unk> together, whether a community was really successful all the individuals of that community to become more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up with so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe in the community board, in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities that have developed communities in many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have lots of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is no longer without the heart, or the muscle of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and created more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened inside these communities.
And these are starting to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not making more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that these communities built built.
In fact, they started <unk> inside the community being responsible for <unk> to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruits because I knew bad and sick for the last time I ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that would have been learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit out.
And so the fact that the nervous system build these information structures enormously accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting here emitting <unk> and, hopefully, building a similar idea <unk> and <unk> in his heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we turned it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work like a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
Now we spend through periods like similar <unk> organisms -- our computer <unk> presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the computer tape, the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in times.
You already saw the <unk> evolutionary <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you about took a billion years of every single one.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, led to a few hundred million years.
The following, the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And the following, as electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose that <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the more you do it.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see that the process is <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that jobs that jobs would not be possible without recent scientific technologies.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to be <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions of millions.
Instead, with the designers, <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that I couldn't get, it goes much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the day.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions <unk>
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all of those programs, and take those that are going on to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to draw numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences.
But once again, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences.
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we get the best to get the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children will get the properties of both of these programs.
So we got a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Listen to it again.
I would take some mutations out there.
And it tries to try again and try another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that would draw very perfect numbers.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to pass them to see how they work.
They are very strangers.
But they get <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they achieve with, because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
One time I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he picks up a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to deliver a <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we start to depend on computers to do different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than it produces the normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing gets faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a time analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now it comes the lunch and I think I stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up a part of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of getting <unk> <unk> talk about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300, a <unk> that we would say, 300.
That means that the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and whatever it is to try to get to the first base of the base, not to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that is somebody who was 10 or hit four.
<unk> like the <unk> Ted Williams, the last player in the <unk> League of <unk> in running more 400 strikes in a regular season.
Now I think this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has a number of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor derived to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 percent.
But do you know that?
She's getting better at this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think is that the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a nurse from a nurse or a <unk>
More good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is sending them into the world, and I put myself included, with the mandate of being perfect.
That ever, never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a full-time student.
Once, a fellow in high school said I was Brian studied to a blood test.
Like this.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the residence of nurses at General General in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, we would take the origin and the <unk> and the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnosis -- frequent -- frequent and not standard.
And I even knew the diagnostic diagnosis about how to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And meanwhile, more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you were going to do everything -- then you would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought to the lady in the emergency service where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when emergency room requested to go to a cardiologist I would go to that patient.
I was reporting to the residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which gave me an heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes forward, the blood goes into the lungs, these are filled with blood, and so there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I want.
I gave it <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave it <unk> <unk> <unk> so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I sat very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I really made two more mistakes in fact.
He sent her home without talking to the chief <unk>
I didn't get the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, it would have been able to contribute <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
I mean, maybe I didn't want to be a resident who will raise constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I would send it to his house, he didn't take attention to a voice on my inside that he would say, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so unhappy that he asked the nurse to <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if you're going to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said with total <unk> "Yes, I think I'm going to be well."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high, and the ambulance next with the ambulance and they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I went on my work.
At the end of the day, I would go back to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was my car to go home. At that time, I did something I don't do normally, I don't do normally, I didn't do anything that I don't do normally, I didn't do anything I don't do normally, and I didn't do anything that I don't do normally,
It went through the emergency service service.
And there another nurse, not the one who <unk> from the lady <unk> before, but another one, told me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors were <unk>
Other specialists are afraid of them, too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: Does you?
"I remember the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In an hour of an hour of having come home after I gave him the high and her family had a collapse and her family called the <unk> the <unk> of <unk> blood pressure with 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a severe shock of it.
I just barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff of emergency.
They gave her medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> it was in intensive therapy and waiting for all hope that was <unk>
And in the two or three days after it was clear that never <unk>
It had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was going to be told what was happening.
And in the ninth day, they left her to go. Her lady and she said, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
So the next few weeks ago, I was amazed about it and experienced for the first time, the shame that there is in our medical culture, and I felt like <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it to your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> which makes us feel very bad inside.
It tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I <unk> things and made sure I didn't get to me.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why was he sent to his house?
And in my worst <unk> Why made it so <unk>
Why did we choose medicine?
And shortly after that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day he opened up the sky and finally came out the sun, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me with myself in which if you put the efforts to be perfect to make no more errors, I would take those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was appointed in the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her thinking, I was a little bit <unk>
He <unk> penicillin and sent him to his house.
But as he ran to the door he was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my head, my boss asked me to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I gave the three words: Does it remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and had no <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but from the upper top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
him, fortunately, he didn't die.
You get antibiotics on it <unk> and they recovered at the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they would get 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't get home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculus <unk>
I had an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out a colleague who was checking the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner and called it to the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He made it a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague that he <unk>
I checked it and to notice some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
Both were operated and recovered as well.
But every single case was <unk> I got <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
I got embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't get it to me and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do you show them this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I could go into a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe that I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that have <unk> results and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical <unk> and medical errors, to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the first article that I wrote to my Toronto <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> white art.
And what I learned is that errors are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes are happening every day, in which one of the 10 drugs drugs are in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system where infection infections are increasingly increasingly and more <unk> and causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die in this country, dying 20,000 Canadian errors <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we are not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so here's things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is added up every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
<unk> deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain, comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and, suddenly, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things like that.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we get <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals of error, well, you won't get anyone.
And with respect to that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> white art, it's a habit saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone towards them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> to slow down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The medical doctor, is human, you know human -- they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They took their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people are not <unk> but a loving way and support for all of them to be <unk>
And he works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes at the time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I am a human, <unk> mistakes.
I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me close with three words -- I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that says to choose a half American American -- are about 70 to a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research week for a week of anonymous presidents group.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks by these executives and the time that we would choose to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, they found <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every work included many, many <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the <unk> category and how many of an hour?
How do you figure out how to deal with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about potential solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When you ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this <unk> supermarket very <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
He was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a park of <unk>
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water <unk> and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was wondering, why never do I buy nothing?
This is the shelf <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in a box that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager of a manager and said, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
And he pointed out to me, the buses filled with tourists which came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
He was putting a <unk> right at the shop.
We put out there for six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a 60 percent, that when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what if they were more likely to buy a cup of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
From those who stopped when there was only three three three up to buy <unk>
When I had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, deciding we don't buy <unk> we're probably going to get <unk> -- less is good for conserving <unk> but it turns out that the problem of choice <unk> affects us in good decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the decisions about savings for about retirement for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of <unk> available plans in savings plans for retirement, <unk> program -- to help people save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they want.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funding, the rate of participation went to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more options, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of choice, more people will be engaged by avoiding actions or investment.
The more options, they were more options, they were more willing to invest in financial reform.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we will make the decision, the decision, even when it goes against our self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to choose less <unk> although objectively it was going to be better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, to contrast and choose from that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in a way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've never heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of <unk> options, there will be an increase in sales, <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Gate corporation actually eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> increased <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and lower costs.
You know that you find them today, on average, you have 45,000 products.
In a <unk> store, you offer about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the current world is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce.
In the world of financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have come from how to handle the choices is the <unk> by David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the employees of Harvard are <unk> automatically to a safe end of life.
The people who really want to choose, are offered 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they won't be able to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience a few holiday on the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you a round of applause. If you're ready to take <unk>
<unk> Okay. Any one who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a <unk>
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I was actually able to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first turn, which is in the second, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were made more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> of choice which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences should feel very <unk> very concrete ways.
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when it uses debit cards or debit than when he uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do it.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
So in that meeting, that <unk> exactly how we had a little <unk>
What we added was that I would give you the staff to think about the positive things that they would take in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a aisle of magazines.
We saw that in the supermarket <unk> along the <unk> <unk> display can contain from <unk> different types of <unk>
But you know?
Because the <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think that the left of the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> Okay. Well, there's a few.
If you think that the left of the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This scheme of <unk> is completely useless.
The categories have to tell you something that we are going to say to anyone who is <unk> not that the <unk>
And you can often see this problem with those huge lists of funds.
I'm supposed to say who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if we just put it a little bit.
We have to increase gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good <unk> a <unk>
This is a <unk> German manufacturer that allows you to completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offer each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order of the order for the decisions.
So half of customers are going to go from many choice, 56 colors, to a few four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go in a few choice, four <unk> in 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to do?"
What are you so involved in you.
If you have a <unk> button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that are going from many choices to <unk> <unk> the <unk> button over and over and over again.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options in many, they continue there.
The same information, the same amount of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which the information is.
If we start with it, you learn to <unk>
Even though you choose the box of change doesn't say anything about the preferences of <unk> inside, in all ways you are preparing for choice.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help manage <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is to be careful about <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can practice <unk> art.
Thank you very much.
In the years, in the <unk> in East Germany, <unk> if you had a type of writing that you had to <unk> in front of the government.
You had to register a sheet of text text with the machine.
And this so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they were writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think of someone who could do this, how much this is going to give freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and it prints a page, that page will end up having some yellow printed dots on every page that follow a pattern that does and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody looks a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
The mobile phone phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a huge amount of them.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> who would take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their <unk> online but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy it in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know your <unk>
And I say today it's more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be about worse.
In the future, most of the crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them protests, they motivate them to motivate them.
And the groups of groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a huge role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the national and governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of heart attack, against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> in the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the break last fall because of a <unk>
They took the safety of the site and lead a <unk>
Last week, I said, in a meeting with representatives of Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if <unk> <unk> death of people because of the heart attack.
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a suicide attack.
<unk> is an Australian authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, services like <unk>
Except that we had a foreign authority authority.
And they gave the <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> <unk> headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had sold him the Egyptian government tools to intercept a large scale the communications of citizens in the country.
They had been sold for this tool.
The company headquarters right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to governments to do that to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspected in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's going further.
It gets <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems to be a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play with privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, whatever right, any right that we're going to spend today, will be forever.
They were blindly <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, in the South National Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, at the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park, of Nairobi has no fences at most of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, such as the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and found it dead in the morning and found it very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe that we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value that much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
Children are <unk> they protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that I was going to do.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were scared.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because it even helped the lions to see the cow <unk>
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick the lions so they believed that it was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he went and they killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come out.
I found out that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which to turn down the lights out.
And this is a little <unk> <unk> lamp.
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> electricity to the small box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> give out the outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's what lions see when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> to the lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never had problems with lions.
And the homes of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked if I could put the lights out.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used for all Kenya, <unk> to frightening other predators, and it's also being used for colorful elephants to farms.
Thank you this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise funds and <unk>
It even led my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So one year ago, it was just a kid in the meadows of the <unk> <unk> cows cows and used to be able to fly, and I was telling me that someday I would be inside of one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in a plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to be an engineer from aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to hear a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions here.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close to the CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented electric fences but I want to do my mine.
CA: So I read it once, once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried before, but I got a <unk>  CA: When I stood out of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to put it in every single step that I would have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt so proud.
In school, we would move all the time by studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
But sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would go through my life in North Korea, until everything changed as a sudden.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public work.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and myself had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And he said, "When I know this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we've never eaten in the two weeks ago.
We're <unk> together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak, we're prepared to die."
I was very quiet.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in his arms looking at her face of her mother's face, no power to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine famine led to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more likely to energy energy cuts all around me on the dark night except for the lights of the sea in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the countries of its neighbors.
This is the <unk> river between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, enabling the North Koreans crossing <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes it looked at bodies floating in the river, sometimes.
I can't reveal the details of how I come out of North Korea, but I can only tell you that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of around North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for the Chinese police, and I was stuck in the police station.
Somebody had been accused by being <unk> then my skills in the Chinese language and asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of them can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> they were eventually released after an international pressure soon.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to escape, a lot of other North America haven't been so lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all the world can be done in a moment.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to take it to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call with a pride of mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea it was not easy, I had a plan. I started studying the <unk> exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had been making some money that sent to my family, and as my family my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location.
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help it escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and approached by a Chinese police officer.
And he asked you to go and start asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me, but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the <unk> border.
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all for releasing my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at the short distance from the South Korean embassy from South Korea.
I was going and came out between the office of immigration. and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man ask me, "What is problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was to the ATM ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and to other two North Koreans and <unk>
I read it with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I get <unk>
"Not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The nice unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when they got it.
And I showed me that the kindness of the unknown and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I came together in South Korea.
But to achieve their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in touch with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North North Koreans all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> stores <unk> <unk>
So the planners of the city got together and they thought, let's change the name of South <unk> to represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles -- as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles --  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert -- Los Angeles <unk> home of food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that places of food to carry on to kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles south.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, Beverly <unk> who's like 15 miles away.
And I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel like they don't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of the house, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see chairs <unk> and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem and it's the solution.
In addition to I already got tired of how I got 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have any <unk>
What I did, was plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet x three me.
The point is, he belongs to the city.
But you have to get it down.
I said, "Well, I can do what it comes in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided it was going.
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> we got together and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- you know, nine complete vegetables ...
What we do is, we are a kind of <unk> group made by gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone got <unk>
The city came up with me and just <unk> a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made it <unk>
And I said, "Come on it?
A court command for plant food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, I am."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition on <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called it to say <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why the hell don't look like this?
You put a single plant, give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, they cultivate your own food.
You know, your own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there, I would get my kids there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You get to see what the land can do, if they let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how does it affect people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became an education tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You get to see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember a time that came and his daughter, and his daughter, were like the <unk> at night and they were in my garden, salt and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who was so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't rely on people going to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh no, I'm not afraid you're going to get to <unk>
It's on the street.
That's what this is about.
I want you to do it, but at once, I want you to take her <unk>
There was another time that I put a garden in a garden in a homeless shelter in the <unk>
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant with their mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so it was just so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who are coming, work and <unk> every volunteer plan.
If kids cultivate <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If they grow some <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you're not taught how food affects your mind and your body eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing that you're caught. I see color kids that are on this path that's designed for them, that it doesn't take it nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity that we can train these kids that were <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
You may have the next George Washington Post.
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all of a block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I don't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because it's free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work to people, pull the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening the farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take your <unk>
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I won't be sitting in comfortable chairs and having meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to kindergarten.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me in which this is a very nice road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water on the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you're going on on your bike and these cars go on, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a road <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands, have pores and water can go through it, so all of the water water flow over the sides and they will have a road that is easy to drive, and you don't get the water out of it.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise away, so it's a very quiet road there.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at that in this road stones on the surface of the surface.
First a stone, then several more and more and more and more and more and more and more, and you can do that.  But they can hurt your <unk> and they're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see what damage is in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so there's only a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> light to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will become <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So if you drive through the road, you take the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use knitting <unk> of that to clean up, and we can cut out the steel <unk> in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one that you see here, you use a <unk> machine <unk>
<unk> can heat off, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is you can heat the steel of steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and stones again to the surface.
I used to have an oven, and <unk> because I can't bring the great machine back to the stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tested a lot of samples there and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave up a piece of road, 400 meters of the freeway <unk> in which we had to make a model of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did in there. You see where we were doing the test test and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know about doing.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did age aging -- we put a lot of charge of charge in them, and we put it up with our <unk> machine, and we put it back into a try.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using fiber meat, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, even increase the life of the road, even to double the life of the surface of the surface to save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity if this also worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how it acts on it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening on News News in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those time, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> <unk> my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he told me.
One morning I never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban <unk> in Afghanistan and made illegal enough girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way the two could be <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route that nobody could be suspect to where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of a hundred <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, students and our parents.
Instead, the school was suddenly suddenly suddenly a week because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew from us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province from Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, went to school and so his father would <unk>
But my mother became a master's degree.
This is her.
It was left two years ago, just to convert our home home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not educating their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give you, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can take your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So, you still want to do not <unk>
I'm 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home to educate her daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't just get away from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman, who I wear it through the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate the women.
That's why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, even though and even in front of an opposition <unk>
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped to be killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to her home, you get a voice to pick up that if you kept sending her daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but no longer hurt the future of my daughter for his old and <unk>
What I've given me from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter, and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first <unk> compelling of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school is <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
<unk> that these changes did not last long after the 401 of U.S. troops in America.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a future <unk> and a <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never have a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution had inspired by mass <unk> and mass <unk> and <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of rage and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men were at the <unk> <unk> each of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a gift to the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East to the west, the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and a loss of about 50,000 dead, they killed our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed infrastructure, culture and moral structure of society <unk>
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved together with many other women, to rebuild civil society -- <unk> an inclusive transition and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique job, I started organizing workshops on the development of capabilities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we started the <unk> of Women <unk> <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, <unk> guidance leaders, to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right of participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very hard environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> that are increasingly <unk> from selfish policies and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was declared and successful.
Women won a <unk> of National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
But gradually the elation of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the U.S. officer.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> rapes of human rights and their lack of the law.
Our society, made a <unk> mentality, and it has gone away from the ideals and the beginning of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here at all here in order to <unk> with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we chose to be wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices don't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
<unk> list and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they don't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> so much for men like women.
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than the elections, which is only <unk> and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of female the more that we need to need <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call it <unk>
We need to begin to act like compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which is not just <unk> but also putting it in practice the mercy rather than <unk> the collaboration instead of the competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for the war, needs desperately to reach the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between women's <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to set out that in an existential way before they do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the <unk> traditions have the same root in Arabic than the word <unk> <unk> female and <unk> that it involves all of the humanity that men and women, from all the tribes and all the villages have been <unk>
And so like the uterus -- just like the uterus covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine extracellular matrix of compassion -- all the same thing.
This is what he goes, "My mercy is all <unk>
This is what he says, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
That all of you will give you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a mysterious question that has an equally known answer.
It's about the secrets of the domestic violence and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody gets <unk> Why is it left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had had <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> <unk> American <unk> and had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I creates my soul <unk> <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man who loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> where they fall every year of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent the most part of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Post.
I've been about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the religions, all of the religions, every income income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and the long duration or said in the families, the last place where we would want or expect to find <unk> reason why domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who was going to go with a man who does it, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States of 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and November night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City, and he started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he also had been <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the thing that struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of <unk>
He did it especially at the beginning of a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me who was so ready that I had gone to Harvard, that I put passion in helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know it all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done before.
And it was why I graduated from that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go from New York and leave my dreams, but I thought I'd make my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I just left my job and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling on a <unk> <unk> who was coming from head on a physical line, financial and psychological care.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it is.
And here is where you go into the scene of those <unk>
As soon as we move to New England you know, that site where you were supposed to be so safe to buy three <unk>
One was the <unk> in the car.
Another guy under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns because of the trauma that they lived with.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and although I never had lifted me my hand, my life was already serious about <unk> every minute of every day.
The first physical attack happened five days before our wedding.
It was the seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's suit and married him.
In spite of what I had happened. I was sure we were living happy for always, because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was simply a very strong sense of <unk> and the fact of making a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident and never more to me.
I spent twice as much as our moon.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon <unk> by traffic and threw a Big Mac <unk>
<unk> followed a year or twice for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or elsewhere in their life, and the Center for Disease Control informing that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know that he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't they just don't get <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me this is the most sad and painful question that people do -- because we were victims, we know something that you know, <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of mass violence in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has put in order to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has become married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's not going to go?
I was able to go back to one last <unk> because of my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, I would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody about the world: the police, to my friends and my friends and family friends and <unk> and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to engage the victims as <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why would it be <unk>
And for some people is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also argued that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to me and that they loved their lives and happy lives, like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor.
I went back to <unk> with a cute guy, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to ever have ever before, is a <unk> <unk> pointing to my head in the hands of somebody who says I will.
Right now, you are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time, I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love breaking the silence.
And I'm still doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my final request for you.
Talk to what you've heard here.
The abuse is only in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They <unk> the <unk> of the light talking about it with their children, their classmates and family friends.
They would take their vision of survivors as fantastic and fantastic people who have a future <unk>
And we would take the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe way.
Together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should have dress that like this.  luckily, I've brought it to <unk>
This is the first shift in <unk> <unk> so you have a lot of luck -- I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when you <unk> you don't have to go on, but you find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of power to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These universities, are very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while you cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, there was never a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and a photographer told me that I would go back and get the hair out of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> as I did two days ago for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how are it going to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery -- and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not just defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry -- which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I have known to take money to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that are now shown -- and maybe there are some <unk> <unk> that <unk> Hold on, where they're <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York I talked all and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models just <unk> is to say, less than four percent, not white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take for that.
But then, what would actually tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you'd be the first.
If after this room, we still <unk> No, no, Cameron -- I want to be model, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> or <unk> executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say most of you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you be larger.
It's out of control, it's surprising, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have a couple of your studies, and you have a couple of jobs and a couple of jobs to your back, whether you want to be the <unk> that you want to be president of the United States -- but you know, you know, you know, you have Model underwear for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
This is how he looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are one of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too many heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to bring money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light <unk> and, of course, we were <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges as I looks, not because I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect without who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of <unk> teenagers who were <unk> and <unk> <unk> were black and Latino and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino young men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's about how many times I was <unk> and <unk>
In investigating for this talk, I found out that the 53 percent of <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up at 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we would get it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative people.
And that's all right, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about it every day every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the happiest hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most brilliant legs -- the brightest hair and the <unk> clothes, but probably the women are physically <unk> on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there's something to keep out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image in the perception of the success and the failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was most enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 <unk> pictures and I didn't get the <unk>
There was no <unk> and no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a little bit of care in lighting in light.
In fact, most of them took tourists randomly.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and <unk>
He happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what it comes now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take me back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you move the <unk>
So here is when we start asking tourists which would happen to us to give us a picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, nobody has no <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five-year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of concrete or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in October a week, and we think about our time and our evolution over the years, not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around, when all of a sudden, she was stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the baby shop, which would be <unk> of small <unk>
And it described to me that there was meaning for five years on that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what he looks at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participate in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who takes a picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and not let me get closer to someone and asked him, and you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It's also been associated with Disney laughs as stupid characters as stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> they don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are mostly in the <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 people face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> are important -- first of all, provide vital ecological services.
They're our <unk> <unk>
<unk> the bodies to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria help to absorb the anthrax that they won't be because they would spread and cause large loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there's no <unk> people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge <unk>
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the license and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto and <unk>
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do a lot of important <unk> to open sky. In places like Tibet -- there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural waste system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the far end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In the South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey on the consumption of livestock consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned from the veterinarian in India and have taken a stance.
Because there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge amount of time bomb, and the number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so to focus on a productive problem, it's not going to be anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that are <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, making noise.
When you leave this room, you would tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed because he saw them by flying without effort, no energy spending on the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
<unk> to <unk> young <unk> but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> of <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
I went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all the things that we want to do.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with seeds <unk> the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach local farmers and Italians and <unk> and ...
And of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would give them to come to work, and sometimes they were not going to be <unk>  We were terrified of the local tools, in such fertile valley, had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't do anything, we just said, "Thank God we're standing up here --  -- at time to save the people of Zambia on the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is.
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never going to be <unk>
I thought that only we did the Italians -- <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, they did what the <unk> did, and then seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk> --  <unk> to see the waste that we gave to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, countries, Western donors have taken the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I won't tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
They just read your book.
It's part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> Mali, <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if they were my children, I want you a lot to have my children.
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa is called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "I'm little <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first side of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened this conference put a cane on the ground, and he said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to just answer the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never get anything, but it will be a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you? Do you?
It would never get to a community with an idea, and it feels with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We came together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what are you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not for a time instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, but not in the community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance you have <unk>
So, planning has this blind place.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't get to their public meetings.
What do we do do we work on one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new career.
The profession is the family physician for the company, the family physician in the business of the business family who sets up in your coffee table on the coffee table, and that helps it find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this opposite garbage that we came to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects on the march, and the government came to me to see what you can do that?
How can you <unk> And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I was <unk>     So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We have done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying from <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the most great business artists, the history of history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business of business.
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you with you.
You have to offer you <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then <unk> will be in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
So what do you talk about is this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the <unk> spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil fossils -- not renewable <unk> and from one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we use <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a master's magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> gathered together this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City was not there in 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in bullshit.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? For the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States -- <unk> generic companies -- <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
In another way, they won't come to speak with you.
Then you have to offer an absolute <unk> <unk>
And then I will have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things -- <unk> the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing -- and you have to tell a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We have never met a human being in the world that can do, selling and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We have tested and looked at the 100 companies in the British world, <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one, no one was started by a single person.
I would never have the word itself, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in coffee and on bars along with their <unk> apples.
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> I want you to look <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us who are around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't save a lot of knowledge despite the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door at a bad time?
How do you share more from our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes more for stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giants that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always altered the music.  There's a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the most beautiful <unk> properties.
I live near this house and I thought how it could turn it into a smaller space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected it.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this made me a profound gratitude for the time living and the time.
It gave the meaningful things of my life today.
But I was trying to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch by the day to day and forget the really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and paint on her phrases for <unk> <unk> <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
After dying I want to be <unk>  "Before I die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
<unk> I want to sing for millions of people."
<unk> I want to plant a <unk>
<unk> I want to live out of the <unk>
"Before I die, I want to give you more and harder."
<unk> I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
<unk> I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes of people made me laughing <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving reflection reflection and <unk> and remembering what's most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started receiving hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the middle of the civic center, we did a kit and now have been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us our opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions instead, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is very short and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that will become more power.
And you think about the death of the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media to share support, fears and stories, the people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's high and very hot.
I don't speak, but it gives you joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> shares what will happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at color color.
They don't care about religious differences and notice about this: has never been <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to tell you words that I could not even know -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> the <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if he stole my <unk> but remember the year that each of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and his Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like <unk>
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit to the concept of a lot of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what he pushed my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you would consider them inside the <unk> it could only mean one thing: which was <unk> <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual it's manifests itself in a different way, that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disorders that will increase in the world, there's no cause no cure or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars around the room, looking at the washing washing washing machine, and to eat anything that there was <unk>
As I was growing more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, and the love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change by normal.
The good thing about the top of the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of you are wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what is right.
If you could put it one thing to <unk> and Sam and Sam and you would have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inner and honestly, the pursuit of normal, is the last <unk> of potential.
The opportunity for greatness and progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please you don't say I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the middle of the <unk>
Penn State asked me a communication teacher to give a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was afraid.  I was afraid.
But when those conversations, those conversations, I felt what it would have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
Just so I felt when I had those conversations with the students, I surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a lot of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our greatest challenges from energy to the environment, and if we don't know what we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as scientists don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please get <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that their science is sexy and their engineering is attractive.
First question for me, and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the <unk> structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when they're describing their science, carefully with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making them silly <unk>
In contrast, as Einstein, would be as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies.
And by presenting her work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you asked yourselves why they call <unk>  What do the <unk> be killed and kill them, and they <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's been up too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that I really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then we will provide graphs that will lead to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they were <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help other open open door and see the country of wonders that science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've got this equation, for all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford <unk> is <unk>
It's just because it sounds pretty well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor of the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looks for a public care, no matter or start, and that, when he wins, gets it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I suppose.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the camera <unk>
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the very famous name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They had thrown in the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to face them, and at the end, he had such popular support in London to won it.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's literal <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you really how words and policy interact, I want you to go back to America, right after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, its leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have been <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> of State <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They didn't think it was <unk>
And it didn't even even with it -- they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given date.
And there might be <unk>
The whole world got tired -- <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of <unk> was against <unk>
The House of <unk> didn't want Washington to become power.
They didn't want to call it the King because he gave him to him or to his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate than it was happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was no longer before, but it only meant <unk> that we would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk>
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet <unk> <unk>
"And who will take him seriously.
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate was not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk>
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to follow there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we will continue to wait for the other years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- I want to tell you, is that the President of President of America doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history has endowed with the title of <unk>
So the end won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, appearance -- well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end, the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do is <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but actually the really changes change a lot more words than what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under the ground in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of rotting bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but especially that cacophony of male <unk> and stones and stones with primitive.
Like others, I wear a cheap flashlight of light <unk> he holds the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole of a meter on the ground.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost control and dropped countless feet in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in the deep side of that hole at the risk of your lives without paying rewards and often dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home but they may never do it, because they're prey for slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> at the Summit of Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there was a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO that is dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not in the grade.
When we end up talking to me that I felt very bad, I was really afraid to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me feel like the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculus says there are now more than 27 million people who are <unk> in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of Africans displaced during the entire slave slave it.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual wage of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about <unk>
However, today you can enslave entire families for generations per percentage of <unk> dollars for 18 dollars.
Amazingly, slavery generates revenues from over <unk> million dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and they can't escape.
Today, slavery operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost all the world, and yet it's illegal to all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met <unk> <unk>
This strange show and <unk> was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, children, in fact, families -- entire families -- in a heavy <unk> two-dimensional sting in their heads, to 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> I would just pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the powder that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't you do it here."
And I explained very clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I was not citizenship in that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for their liberation and trusted the <unk>
As to me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids carrying little <unk> stones for miles on <unk> <unk> until trucks were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children than the <unk> and the children were taking them on their head with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been so all his life.
They have nothing with what to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had lost their homes.
When you hear the word slavery often we often think about sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness, they warned me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously been sexually <unk>
It led me to a little bit stairs that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local.
They have small rooms, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them only seven years -- they're forced to entertain customers and to <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every post is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sex abuse by their customers.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where I <unk>
There was no <unk> doors.
There were no big windows for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a very difficult thing, it's important to point that slavery, even sexual <unk> happens to us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 Americans and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slaves every year.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families on the trade of the silk.
This is a family.
The black hands of black are the father, and the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
You don't hope, though, yet you can get out of this house someday and go to another place where you really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 <unk> <unk> the largest American lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went through a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen in a boat, two young brothers -- some more young children, some more young, a sense of a sense.
<unk> They were all <unk>
The children are separated from their families and they were forced and forced to work large <unk> in these boats in the lake, even though not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to was <unk> I mean, his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The <unk> branches of trees in the lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and with fear, they hit the water to unlock the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, has always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of her love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it tries to the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when I took the last networks, but they had been working on the last one.
<unk> and <unk>
And I'm going to point that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the <unk> to the <unk>
Kofi doesn't.
Who will come because somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
It was a road in Ghana with partners with <unk> partners the <unk> a fellow who had their <unk> suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
It asked us to take it through a road of land to the forest.
At the end of the way, we would give us out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
And then you signal this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started going down, we take away the <unk> and then we took away the <unk> and then we found that the way near an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as I put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up <unk> in a course and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their backs and, while they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> water.
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These <unk> are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well, they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been underground for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 90 feet and these people have to carry heavy stone bags that then will be shipped back to another area where they put the stone to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer to close to the margin we see at least less fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this would end up as this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in mines.
By the death of his uncle, they <unk> the debt of the uncle that force it to be slave in mines.
When I met her, he had worked in the <unk> in the 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that doctors were saying that it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he has been liberated and <unk> with help from local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, the face of a remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to give witness to them and we will make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves each other as human beings, then it makes it very hard to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not magazine from people, and real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that happens that I don't think about these so many beautiful people who have had the great honor to meet.
I hope these images wake up a force in which you see them -- and I hope that that force turns a fire and that that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math math and there's a peculiar problem for whom we <unk> we are like management disease."
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk> -- that we will see later on.
But the demand for a degree of extraordinary training is a high level of skill and probably some <unk> initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time was a virtuous dancer dance.
In the last few years, it has made a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a weakness <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to be able to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there's really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological <unk> so they don't serve the blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological test.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside the clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test ourselves?
It would be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do, as a conventional way for a try, you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration <unk>
It shows somebody healthy as it emits sounds like talking, and we can imagine as a dancers of a happy friend because we have to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes needed -- for example.
And, like <unk> requires an extraordinary <unk>
Think about the time that it takes a child to learn how to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal vocal <unk> as <unk> and Parkinson's disease is also affecting the <unk>
In the bottom plot you can see an aesthetic example of the vibrating strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
<unk> test is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also the exams on voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're at minimal cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a lot of <unk> it appears at mass scale.
These are some incredible goals to address.
We can reduce the problems of the patients.
I don't need to go to the clinic for the follow-up <unk>
<unk> we could get goals.
We could do it a massive amount of cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So by giving you the first steps in that sense, we are releasing the <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to address these goals.
We have accessible lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without Parkinson's, it can call low price and leave recordings by a cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let me take all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What's happening is that during the so-called <unk> you have to indicate whether or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people can not be <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors factors in search for real markers of disease.
TR: You have an precision <unk> at this moment?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to have a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network, too, what we <unk> the project. Now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's better.
<unk> of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I made <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the dark, in no windows and usually, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin -- we can even be able to make the impossible <unk> and we were going to focus on the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with a lot of years of experience and real delighted by the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
And shortly after that, an organization where I was <unk> where I was <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay in the house, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishing village village in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The <unk> water level reached over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers in the land.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took off the slime and leave it ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We <unk> and they loved it.
Over weeks, volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and photos and <unk> cards and <unk>
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places from people around to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were growing up of the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the toilets, giant <unk> giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
There were the honor and I had the honor that that day would be <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard of the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went through my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some people were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think of how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to be <unk> with much precision and <unk>
And so that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
At the time of time, they came up with more pictures and needed more <unk> so he came up on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people who were <unk>
In Japan, in July, we would give us a village town north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in libraries of libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their pictures.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended of course <unk>
I could get an hour. It could be a couple of weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw basically by hand using a guide and the areas whose color and detail had no destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures that are held in water water, covered with bacteria, even with algae, and even with <unk> all of it along with the time I continue to continue -- so I was working on hand was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture at least that I was clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky for hand.
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the pictures ...
As once he said that the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
I had started <unk> she was stopped by realizing it will be even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not be <unk> we were able to put the images into a single picture and put the whole picture.
When I picked his pictures shared something from his story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the pictures at a fire station between the rubble of the rubble quite far away from where she used to be his house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
His little children, not as small now, but their two children were at school in a different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find his entire family and know that everybody was gone.
The day I gave her his pictures his little child was 14 years old.
For her, even though all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could remember from the past that had not been made of the past day, when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
And after six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up to where hundreds of them helped us clean up for more than <unk> photos -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority of the hands of their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families and hundreds of <unk> photos and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend more than a thousand dollars in teams and materials, most ink to <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, a place, a relationship, somebody loved people.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would have but the first thing that we would look for.
Over this was the project, of restore small bits of humanity, from bringing back to somebody with the past.
When a picture like this one would give somebody, it's not a huge difference in the life of the person that you get in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something larger, to bring something, using your talent for something that is not going to be thin color models of perfect skin.
I would just like to read this email and I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't help but think of people and stories shown in the images.
A particular one, a picture with women in a lot of ages from grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, I and my daughter <unk> hangs from our wall.
In the whole world, in all the very few of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you. <unk>
<unk> were inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition on one billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion <unk> but a billion frames per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the inside of the body without using X-rays, and <unk> really the camera idea.
If I take a laser laser and I switch it into a <unk> second, you know, in a number of <unk> you will create a whole package of photons just one millimeter away.
And that photons, <unk> -- that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet is going to happen.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how are those photons inside this <unk>
What is the light aspect of light in camera.
Now, all this --  -- remember, all this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  <unk> lots of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a photons package that starts <unk> and that inside, starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that goes on inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the insights on the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, the thoughts are <unk>
Now, if we take a common and current <unk> and we make the same distance and see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much people think it would take us to see that movie?
One day?
It would be a very boring film,  of a slow <unk>
And what about to do with nature <unk>
You can see the waves of the table, the <unk> and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes look at a big composition of course.
But if you look at once more and more of this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light gets rid of the <unk> it keeps brilliant.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces on its inside and goes back and forth after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is mature without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture on the lower exhibition, it comes very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shorter exposure -- so I could barely get some light.
So we sent that <unk> that photons, <unk> millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. <unk> enter the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
We could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We've built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works that fast, our <unk> has unique capacities to it.
It's got very good <unk> and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects -- but we don't know what point corresponds to how a distance.
When you project a laser projecting a laser picture, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it at <unk>
This is our rebuilding
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going on the way around.
Or we could look at survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light as reflected by open windows by the open windows.
Or could we build <unk> capable of seeing inside of the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But, of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite difficult, so actually this is an order to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new modality of visualizing the problems of scientific mammography for the next generation.
As <unk> <unk> himself was a scientist, became science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the data <unk> that we collected every time are not just for scientific visualizations but we can be able to see that we can.
It will create a new form of computer photography with slow and slow <unk>
Let's look at those waves -- remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here also happens something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are leaving us.
The waves should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects, Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order where the events occur in the world are sometimes invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life and give you an individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, it can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and you will go up and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people would come up with a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they would go on for a change, had a cell phone in our pocket.
Who from the <unk> have a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot, almost everyone today has a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about me about my phone, and how I changed life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> lines of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is said that every European company, every European company in Europe, has to store a broad range of information information.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where do we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and until two years, in your phone company or your Internet <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this database of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone providers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret South Africa.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> who was in that time, was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information they had on me.
I asked them once, and I went back to wonder, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the end, I agree.
And they took the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> 30 percent of information.
At first I saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a time I realized it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I go at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So along with <unk> <unk> and Open It's City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and stop, go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But of all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one on the other, and we end up with this great communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other and what time they are communicating to each other, what time they are going to go to each other.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who sends an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in the streets of 1989, they had a mobile phone in the streets of 1989, they had a mobile phone in the streets of 1989, they had a mobile phone in the streets of 1989, they had a mobile phone in the streets of
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And, as a result, neither of the <unk> <unk>
Because today, state agencies and businesses want to store so much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to do it forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and it's not very low.
When you go home, you get to your representative that only companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information <unk>
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to come to you to remember that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDxUSC. What happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDxUSC. What happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why they were <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, although they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm not <unk> I'm not a source of inspiration.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a ride.
Christmas <unk> are in the shopping center, drive in circles and <unk> and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little <unk>
Also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a gold <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, a disabled woman, living in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same first first.
I also love that if I want to walk from my home to New York, I would be.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three major sisters were <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents went to the public school, my parents would come to the school system and get away from me, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note out, all of it took the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at five years to put my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang a dollar on front of me to make it <unk>
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> <unk> who has gotten a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all the family.
Now there are 20 oceans, and they're still all the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign campaign.
The people who grew up had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of hungry people during the <unk>
I was telling them that I had enough fat to live three months without eat, so you see the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy -- so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm in New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were wearing <unk> I would too.
And when my friends were going to go through the summer vacation at the coast of <unk> I wasn't coming.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get us into <unk>
And in the summer holiday I was often trying to <unk> so I was drinking <unk> and so I would drink warm cups on my back, I was stuck in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before we do yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk>
And now I can put it in your head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the University of the State of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> the pet department of the theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass of the glass of my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a piece called very slow <unk>
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with cerebral palsy,
So I started screaming at the four <unk> I will end up with a <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of the end, <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the <unk> of the theater, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask him why and she told me that because they believed that I couldn't do the risk stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk stunts -- it can't be <unk>
It was a paper that literally had been born and gave it to an actor without cerebral palsy,
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors with no disabled papers.
When I graduated home, I went home, and my first tour tour was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, he stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> of <unk> not <unk> actors were not white, with disabilities.
Just give it to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
In my first first tour I took comic comics from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that led when he fell at the account that I was going to go high speed on the freeway of New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral palsy,
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk> <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they find quite fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival from New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind you to <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was just like invited to the news program, which is the back with Keith <unk>
I went on as if it was a graduate dance dance to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling to the piano <unk> to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I ended the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but I was just like <unk> and I hit my chair.
Something fun that I learned at direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The kids are <unk> but they never get away from me and no more girl and the older ones.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> <unk>
What does it have?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we had grown up with the media, but I don't think it will be.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be <unk> less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the entire society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> by Susan <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I arrived in a movie with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world's Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in the New Jersey state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started "The children of <unk> a charity to give young refugee children, a little bit of what my parents would come back.
It was the only time my father saw me in alive, and I do this talk to her memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know your story.
He lives in a little town to the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives a little town to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the great city in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there is no job, there's no job, no longer in future.
He's just living in a tent in the city at the outskirts of <unk>
After maybe a year ago, there is nothing.
One day he got about a man who offers him to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, who gives him a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to their family.
They show a young man.
He was home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb.
That little boy in that little town with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were <unk> a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how the story of a little boy in a little town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for a chance, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that took him from what we call "the period of <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of well-being, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them opportunities -- the history of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> will be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital and <unk> thinking, and if I never had he gone?
And if I had seen forced me to be at that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually in order to train a few juvenile leaders at a business rate.
<unk> about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because I was a college student, <unk> frustrated, I was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorist organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> tables to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand to hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is it different this story?
What does this story do differently?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> of <unk>
We were giving the young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so cheap.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from abroad.
If you give someone, someone was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers to wedding by creating gardens in the homes, and the city companies -- and now it's working in the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, who could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So I inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas.
They need expertise and orientation to <unk> in the development and put it in their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to go from conception to the creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think he's selling hope.
Their Park Park is how they call it when it is created, and it is creating the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent to rent and keep <unk>
It gave them the opportunity to escape paralysis of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young people in entrepreneurs, and they were eating their innovation -- and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area in the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be the way that we were going to be able to pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square feet with heart hearts -- <unk> balls of paper and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought was going to clean up his <unk>
That question went on with me, and you get a little bit.
<unk> our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where they <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our garbage, for <unk> tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his routes and I interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get a little bit more.
So I began to work like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And operated the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody knows about smell.
It's there, but it's not as rich as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong you will become quickly.
It costs a lot of used your weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of taking on their tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the waste collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering traffic all day and they go through you around you.
They just want <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause they become terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of trash.
When you leave the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
You never stop coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always must be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that the <unk> of waste are the most important work on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the efficient and effective form of every day, this starts to take away from their container and their dangers inherent in very real ways.
We know that we had controlled for decades and centuries coming up and they start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered to the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out their relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed we need.
I mean just the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We're usually not going to have no longer <unk> and we had a coffee cup of coffee, our bag of the water <unk>
We use it, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that will take advantage of it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help to reduce the stigma and we will engage in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, in the <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a kind of relief.
The flow that keeps us except for ourselves, of our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always must be in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection collection on the street, I grabbed my little son and went down the stairs and he went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of paper and he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be OK."
And shortly after that, I started looking at the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> and we work together many times and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species, we have to have in account for all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor hand.
The municipal waste -- what we think when we talk about junk represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable proposition.
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next thing to see someone whose job is to clean the garbage out of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work focuses on the connection to think about our community life to form part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and traditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several floors in the capital of Addis Addis Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to designs.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects of <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores that people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> coating is made heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it comes to a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the whole year.
And thirdly, what it looks like is nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a worthwhile to be a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure to free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using external space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several stories applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to <unk> the site, which is located in an area of a lot of growth in the city, where most of the buildings that we now see in the picture, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets <unk> all the inputs of the building.
And this spreads out of a <unk> <unk> that creates a space in the open air in the building that is <unk> by its own shape of the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, changing every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would lead to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a concrete shell, with <unk> to allow the air input and also from light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons.
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the light on the building to illuminate the building at night.
And with these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It was not what they <unk>
But at all, we all realized that this market idea was actually going to be much more profitable than the market center was so much more profitable than to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity will cut down almost every day.
So we got a big advantage to put <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we thought of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water for the <unk>
You wait for the early year, because we are at the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a teacher of 2,000 apartments and services in a city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest I have designed, I needed not just understanding the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, and the tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve feet of direct access to almost straight.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was expand the streets -- and creating 12 early blocks similar to size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some strategic points in relation to the idea of gates <unk> with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as a <unk> part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So let's make a scheme that sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the plant, we have all the connections to the spaces.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a greater density in higher levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost to give back to the community that is busy using construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and make activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives is changing communities and local economies, at the same pace that buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have to be able to connect nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had big amounts of hair very bright hair and a small <unk> of pencils cute was <unk> very strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
I was a day after the way out of school, I was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom of the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took out of my master's book <unk>
And then, I did.
It will take up the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a few views.
All the <unk>  And I set up the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows out of <unk> and myself a row out of that, just because of being there, because they <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was <unk>
I will never get me.
But above all, I was given to the reason that I would tell me that this little little girl was so good at <unk>
Would jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies have jealousy.
Also the primates. <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the <unk> or the sadness.
And so you have to go to fiction, because the novels are like the lab where we study <unk> in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if I would have gone, it would have no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king of <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
There wouldn't be big.
I was reading the reading lists of high school school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> or <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and, in terms of the age of all, most of them have all of them.
This year is 100 years of his work <unk> "In the <unk> time -- <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot about how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, <unk> but we think it's <unk>
Let's see why they're so well together, the novel and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the teeth that are reduced to the person, their wish, to their <unk> are a nicely <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel vodka -- we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being storytellers and audience, we know exactly what a little bit of detail <unk> to nail the knife, right?
<unk> are given to all novelists <unk> and that's something that I was able to understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to be said to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh act that <unk> it detects in his lover, adds to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the big amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
<unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> the language <unk> with the jealousy.
When you <unk> it is in his agony of segments of soon listening to the gates and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover, then they were all these behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different at the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "Oh these scientific research with real monetary value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, a really painful truth, in fact, at the same thing to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> -- these were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer, causes us to have a range of feelings much more profound and vital man than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> disclose ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look very <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young man who was consumed with the idea that her woman would <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man who didn't get <unk> in what his wife was.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or was <unk> <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how <unk> do us look at intensity but not accurately.
In fact, the more expensive we are, in fact, the more we become women's residents more than fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to violent acts of violent or illegal.
<unk> drives us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at eight years old, <unk> -- but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which they would send horrible messages to himself, for one year.
For a year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former <unk> "I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How huge does creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character from American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to deal with how to express our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> at a moment.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes out of <unk> or want what you have to get out of your being and <unk> from what you've ever <unk> and is under the floor -- <unk> your name, takes your rings, and it takes your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route by Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
That is, we are good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not safe, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think of <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but they <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in the fall of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once he <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there is no person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. And I think this is very emotional -- that scene is mysterious, right?
It looks like to treat them as a problem of geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a <unk> minute, it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute, they're the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It might still be so easy.
What if <unk> are really a problem of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get away from the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction -- compare jealousy.
<unk> alone invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the terrifying Tom <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on gray surface is the culmination of a collective <unk> process.
The program of Apollo was the biggest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a few 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and universities government agencies.
They died people, including the Apollo crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, of which we stayed after death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They did not have a lot of <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that the president Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And they could also ask, why is it going to scale the most <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why do you fly about <unk>
Why is Rice playing Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're tough. It's hard.
Jason <unk> For the 1990s, it was not just a victory of the West about the east in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> to the significance of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great power to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological affairs.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they went down the <unk> and the smallpox.
The technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a ship with candle -- but in 1969, the Apollo crew of Apollo 10 flew for 40,000 miles / hour.
Since 1970, no human will become the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of the Apollo <unk> 10, and the optimism <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to have been <unk>
I remember <unk> <unk> 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> tube of the rocket <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that thing happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists to have been <unk> and they were being enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't understand the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation <unk> in Silicon Valley, that <unk> who have created less ambitious companies that were <unk> from the years to go on, Intel and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in concrete, the incentives that the capitalists venture capitalists are offer to entrepreneurs for.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment led to create the creation of ideas that are inspired by funding problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment investment, which they could go out in 10 years.
The <unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit of technologies as energy, that they need a huge capital and the development is long-term in the long term, not in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have a commercial value right now.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound things.
Sometimes we chose to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But to go to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's world's energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Wind and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want the sources of alternative power sources that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, those entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties development -- development of an increase in the research and development development, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the current climate climate that we will see that we will see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that looked like technology, is not to be.
We know from the time that famines are a result of failure on the food system.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are policies that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like the harvest or systems for the storage and the storage of food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant guys to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need to be <unk> but these four elements of being <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must really be a <unk> problem, and we must understand it.
The <unk> mission has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, it does with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like this in the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a great decrease of trust, it's a very general belief,
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should get rid of trust.
I think that <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And I'm going to bow to think that there may be dropped in some activities or institutions and that might have increased in others.
I don't have it.
But I can turn into behavioral polls and surveys of opinion are supposedly the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at surveys of opinion over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half a way.
But is this evidence enough?
What the record opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you look at is the <unk> attitudes that people are doing when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
You probably want to say, "What do you ask what?"
And that would be a very strong response.
And you might say, "Well, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but on other no."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't think that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a particular kind of official, and the person or a person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain teacher that I know to give you the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my youngest friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've gotten those evidence in our daily lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we let all of that knowledge when we think about trust <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real trust level, because they try to give you the good judgment of an inherent judgment to trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think those people who were taking their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart objective in this life.
<unk> deposited deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yes, that says, yes, that means that what matters to the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
So it's about making a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if you find that a person is <unk> in the raw materials, and it's responsible for and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible for us, but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do very close before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to do.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and others, who made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that I will go into <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives, and <unk> that the system of accountability that is meant to ensure the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know the similar examples.
So let's get all that, by the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we are going to be worthy of trust being worthy of trust and <unk> to people that we are reliable and whether to determine whether other people or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the <unk> which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
They went to the task to rebuild the confidence, put things into the other way.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they are two people, and they do trying to improve trust trust.
But trust, ultimately, it's <unk> because they give us the other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the basis enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford to, usually all the time all the time.
But you also have to add <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That goes every day, everywhere, they do the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I bought my socks out that I can tell you that I can tell you that I can <unk> without giving us anything.
I wear it and get the money, or they get them through the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing at is not a very hard thing to <unk>
What people trust is the relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of the computers we've been <unk> we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly becoming increasingly and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the bottom of a <unk> glass and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
So I started to imagine how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that gets <unk> in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen of your physical body to the pixel up.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool is break the barriers.
But both of the hands remain still on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill ability.
In the Science division of Science and Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
We put a transparent bombsight with the depth cameras to detect your fingers and the face, you can now lift your hands in the keyboard, get inside of 3D space, and grab pixels directly with the hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and <unk> lines or words with the tactile touch sensor that is down every floating screen.
We architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further away, I thought, instead of seeing pixels in the space, how we can make it physicists so we can be able to <unk> and <unk>
How would it be like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my <unk> Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical prototype.
This imam <unk> it behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic <unk> <unk> mechanic and <unk>
And to programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> physically and distance away, and the famous thing about Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality the times that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience, you can touch and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to get away from our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school to athletes with all the <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they create firmly that there was only an accurate way toward the <unk> a safe job and <unk> work.
No matter whether I would want or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer to be a Chinese opera.
This was me, at my imaginary piano.
One of the opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I just wrote to the director of the school and the speaker of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
I just loved friends -- but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much more to train.
My dream was never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life is the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> OK.
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> of course.
"The Good <unk> it's about Chinese <unk>
And it's not a serious <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> trap and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my <unk> <unk>
It <unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me, because this is what the students in China will learn.
I had never happened that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are all the way to research fields like comparative literature and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading was working for research, why don't we do it in <unk> life.
So I started reading books from two.
It can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and duty to <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- instead of losing in translation, I found that you can gain a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to come back or powerless ever.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion comes from, where the happiness comes from.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of books, which I'm here -- happy living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a woman in 26 years called <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a third <unk> He threw her on the couch of my office and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it became easy to just move my head while I had the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so I saw she was right.
You start to work later, you get home later, you have children later, to death later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had plenty of time.
But soon after my <unk> I <unk> pushed me to Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yeah, it's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry it."
And then my camp said, "It's still not, but maybe it was <unk> on the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in the development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only to Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to adulthood without going before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yeah! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove sleep -- a <unk> I want to see. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be 35 years old.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give them a way to your life have happened to be 30 and <unk>
People of more of 40, not <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you get.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, it's now the time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top to the 28, and the things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years is crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which its everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the time of <unk>
The researchers call <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you pat a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Not anything.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it wasn't absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, very interesting <unk> like you or your children get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't notice. I'm just killing the time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I'm going to start a career before 30, everything will be well."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better read the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running, but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was going to be stop, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds just a little bit extreme, but not the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's an enormous pressure to 30 and so many of you start a career, pick a city, to pick a partner, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that you start to show -- which is a lot more difficult and stressful thing to do everything from <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red <unk>
It's to realize that you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> tells you that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I was sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was they doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the guys are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma got to my office because it was in his own words, having an identity.
He said that he would like to work in art or entertainment, but they still couldn't be <unk> so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living <unk> it was very difficult, their previous life, had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then you get up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose their friends."
Well, one day she got his head on his legs and cried for almost every time.
I just had to buy a new book book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then you got to see the empty space that follows after the words <unk> in favor of <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if you give me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually was <unk>
She needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot of since I worked with Alex as to just sit while I was reading by Emma going on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that <unk> from that identity of identity and <unk> of identity.
For identity, I mean, do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity makes identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, of that company that you want to try it.
I am not <unk> <unk> exploration -- I'm <unk> exploration that I should not have to count, which, by the way, is not exploration, it's not exploration.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that to explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the guys who come together with friends with similar minds are just limited to who you know, what you think about, how do you think about how they think, and where they work.
That new capital piece, that new person who comes out almost always comes out of their closest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak ties friends from their friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half not, and the weak links are the form of <unk> this group.
Half of the jobs that we have never been <unk> then I know the head of your neighbor is how to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not less important, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family, when he has a couple and a community in their own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit on your head that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or let you stay now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you get it, and that means being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of doing it will work or kill time with anyone who will be <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a quarter of a cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That job of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend that I alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves his new family, and I sent to a letter that he said, "Now the spaces of emergency cells are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fit in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the same way, at the age of 25 or even 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk> that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma every day, <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get a capital of identity, use their weak bonds choose your family.
Don't define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management management for a work that was even more <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students, in public schools in New York.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
So let me homework.
When the work went back, they cut grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance did not have scores <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you're successful in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to university to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios. And in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do as far as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers <unk> working in really difficult neighborhoods, and what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school of school and <unk> who will be the most effective way to improve the results of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, asking me what these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
and who will make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't good look, physical health and wasn't I.Q. I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have <unk>
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my thoughts of determination and then waited for about a year of a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly bigger chance of <unk> even when the <unk> in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> evidence -- even security they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where it matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for kids at risk of <unk>
To me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know how much science has been able to development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How can we develop the determination in children?
What do I have to do to teach children a solid ethic for work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the causal determination is no related or it is even related to the talent measures.
Until now, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that I developed at Stanford University.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when the children read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they are much more prone to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions -- and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to start to start everything again with the <unk> lessons of it.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother, the beauty, and the shape of the Chinese characters Chinese.
Since that time, I was amazed at this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering whether I can break down this <unk> so that whoever is like to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic freedom.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read a lot of traffic signs -- to understand the basic idea of web pages or paper.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you may be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who goes for a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person in both sides, as if I were shouting at a <unk> <unk> I am <unk> I'm <unk> This is actually <unk> in the form of the flame -- but I like to believe that it's the other way. The one that would work.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of gates in the old West <unk>
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old say, two are a company, three are <unk>
If a person dating his arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a doubt, as a <unk> in the whale as <unk>
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a speaker speaker, is quite an idiot.
Do you remember <unk>
Two years together, it becomes very hot.
Three years together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon, shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the <unk> horizon.
A door. Put a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played is somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've already happened for almost 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, they will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing you learn from a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains, stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> would take their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the picture has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where it comes out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician magician together.
The film took his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic wand to take a magic wand
But when you see that film, so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex view of a child <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to the past 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal kid and a <unk> kid <unk> a girl dresses as a member of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician, and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the magician magician will do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling <unk>
<unk> the magical shoes to defeat the <unk> made by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing of the magician magician, is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I made Star Trek to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a child.
Just three years.
It was not invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> level there was <unk>  And so she summed up in the room and was struck by the room and was struck like a mom with his <unk> behind, and I didn't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
He would have a sense that Luke was one to cut the government?
This is the <unk> <unk>
How does Dorothy win his movie?
They do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, and not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much of the toxic <unk> <unk> force in movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of the movies of male violence on the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know for experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served to navigate the world of the adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss of really expected to be going on, because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is done, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are many exceptions, and to defend the Disney <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though them, they're not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend them against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend ourselves from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, and so lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of every time is continuing to show up in classic after classic each of them about the adventure of a child, or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who bred a little girl.
Until a lot of you are thinking, this year, it finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Remember what criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It still hasn't made roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book book and in the mid-'80s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of mine on the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have to be <unk> in the film, there is more than a female guy who has lines?
So you have to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Your conversations are about something else in the guy than so much like <unk>  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I really see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality movie.
Right? <unk> <unk> success -- an idea of what is a Hollywood picture of what's a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the phosphorus crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, in the 100 <unk> films how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he was saying.
In the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but when I hear that statistician, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they not achieve <unk>
They're <unk> the story of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We're taking that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal like <unk> <unk> and we expect that to be <unk> but I have to ask, "Hey, <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mostly parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the way we care about home and <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter who was his favorite Star favorite character, Do you know what I <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress in it.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people in order to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where it looked like their work is to join a team, maybe a team led to women, helping other people improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I really liked was looking for sea fled on the shores of Maine, because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I would give you to <unk>
I began to see ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, had grown up to one of almost 1,300 miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern delta of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, it seems to be brown but when we use the infrared and process that using <unk> color suddenly the place looks like pink pink color.
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape of building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old American city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, <unk> architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this enormous <unk> of <unk>
This area is enormous measures about <unk> by <unk>
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved into this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find the random that would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the <unk> eyes, and using baseball.
So we use data from NASA to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where we get the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, and this is even more interesting, and this is just more interesting, that you see inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists doing <unk> jobs you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like you take it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation for us.
Five feet down, under a thick <unk> we found a dense layer of objects of ceramics.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> <unk> of several hundred years that date from the Ottoman Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which proves that there was a <unk> shop there.
This might seem like it's not too much, but when we think about the most common rocks we used in the jewelry of the Ottoman Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense <unk> layer that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a jewelry shop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we would take a place in a future near <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in using satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire -- probably it was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to TED -- TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas were actually happening in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the <unk> search in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door to go home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They're competing with a <unk> <unk> and they go in direction to their <unk>
I need to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong -- they're <unk> they're going to <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that go on their side of the wheels that they end up in <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door.
The <unk> to the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that he talks about.
You can feel your blue <unk> you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you're going to go into the mouth.
They put on one side and enter your living room.
In the room, and making the maximum use of imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's very little clothes, dancing about his <unk> <unk> singing <unk> I was <unk> One more <unk>
It's now <unk>
The ground has been coated with a yellow <unk> road and the <unk> comes to you and <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that is done every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> -- I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different <unk> and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> just just once.
They put the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
I write whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomenon of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and have one of the best memories <unk>
And I said, "You know, when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who deals with this competition says they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old ancient techniques -- invented two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used to <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that the <unk> academics used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English one, although a little bit of <unk> said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of <unk> live on national TV.
That would share the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me me.
I mean, you have to start by something <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem that's awesome.
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk>
We went back in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the way back, was a number of treaties on the memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> and disciplined memory was not one thing as rare as you can look like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made us possible our modern world, but they've also changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed the cognitive too.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it looks like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there is to be like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of University College College London invited a group of memory, in the lab.
They wanted to know, to be able to be brains in some way, structural brain or different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're smarter than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference between the brains of the memory of memory and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a <unk> <unk> <unk> your brains while they were <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed to <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament in the competitive <unk> is driving as a armed career in where each year has someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors should have a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times playing memory.
On his desk in front of him, there are 36 <unk> <unk> <unk> that he is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he <unk>
He used a very similar technique to memorize the order of <unk> digits <unk>
A half hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these techniques, absolutely all the techniques used by the end of the end is reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says this: I tell two people who remember the same word. I'm telling you to you, <unk> that there's a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
So what do you do?"
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that her work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity. That's weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, doesn't really mean anything for you. It's no relationship to you.
With all the other memories you dance in their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk> hands.
They do well when they go home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you put that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if she wanted to give a very good party, it was not brought to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up standing up, and he would take her poem from memory, and it was <unk> and so soon it was, the classroom was <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed them all of them, but it shattered the bodies.
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stood outside, the only surviving <unk> in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting every night.
I took the family of <unk> hand to where their loved ones were out of the rubble.
What you have noticed is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we are not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have a visual memory and fantastic <unk>
If I would tell you that I would give you the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to find it very hard to do it.
But I would bet if you asked them to say who was sitting on the <unk> horse in your lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember. The deepest the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- is the <unk> image, it will be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make a talk and you want to do that, in the same way that I would have done it -- if you were invited to <unk> it was 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image to help you remember that the first thing that you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine coming into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> over Mister <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they put it into the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is like <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not word for word, which is going to confuse but, typical typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek, which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase first <unk> would be like the first place in your memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a whole thing about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk>
Seriously, is how to see a lot of people sitting taking exams. I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone is <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there's amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put me in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sit at the New York Times, trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school dropout in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was a funny thing to do.
I would never expect you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train memory.
What it's actually about to do is make it better and more and more the ability to create and imagine these images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape, just two <unk> because the signature is the worst enemy of a memory of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could put in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone phone numbers, and it doesn't really get the point.
These are just <unk> <unk> that work.
Because they are based on quite basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We have to focus on when we focus on.
The palace of the <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
We have a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of you are not going to be <unk>
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things get <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, it's what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence of what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side to our side.
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capacities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about the last 30 years of history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It is a complex issue, so we would take a place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I was living there at my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
On the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everybody passed on the television -- so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me, and every time I got <unk> and I went back in a towel -- all of me saw.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> and I hated it.
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, not about <unk> culture, but of those connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Financial Protection Agency --   Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell you about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think of it so because based on a building built two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a <unk>
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection to the ways we build our buildings.
It's a <unk> emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build homes.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is scary.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library of <unk> which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, has a <unk> has this round thing, columns, brick brick -- that leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> children, human values history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, they are both called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects that constantly drives new technologies, new technologies -- new solutions for today's forms of life.
<unk> we tried and we tried so much, we get away from the people.
And all of black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have any other choice.
We need to go to the other side and connect to these <unk> symbols together.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started as <unk> so we started to swing the pendulum back ahead and over and over again. So we've done this in the last 300 years, and of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> years ago.
We architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be a guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Something really hard.
So we are approaching the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know about and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give it <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into pairs that can be <unk> made of glass.
The forms are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
nuts.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial malls and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to the French or the Italian one.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we need memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
We architects feel frustrated and start to swing the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have new design techniques -- we now have new design techniques -- and we find ourselves with new ways -- a few ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> academic <unk> were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times, <unk> this building of <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew up a half thousand when the building.
So all of a sudden, the whole world wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, and Chicago, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first architect star.
But how is it possible that these different forms of wild and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and we quickly learned that those shapes they meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennials happened with other leading architects.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few of these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, for example, how architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to walk up to the next town to see a building.
The transport is <unk> you can take a ship, an airplane, you can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, so that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't cost a long time to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before knowing whether that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we meet buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a year of two years, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen, because we're on the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the <unk> of steel or <unk> and the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the <unk> of media, it starts to swing faster and faster and getting to being in both extremes of almost <unk> and <unk> actually the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols of <unk> symbols of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community -- and as the drawings looked like exactly when it finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to get and share it in social media, the building left to be just a building, it became a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal storytelling, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, what can a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> people in <unk> and tell you that there's no unique response to what a library is going to be.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated drawings and one is no longer a <unk> public who doesn't embrace something that I haven't seen before.
The architects can listen to it, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
And that means that the <unk> of one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go forward and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical brick of red brick based on ideas of what it should be the stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that are going to make.
That means that buildings are <unk> the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage <unk> in Miami Coast, Florida, it can also serve for a sport or to <unk> or even one can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East Side of New York, and raise half a million dollars in the community together around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this small pavilion pavilion so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build what we build.
We architects know how to do more <unk> buildings, and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not at the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot at play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them a way to the most <unk> spaces the local libraries of households where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and already started walking.
And it does that in a great way of great typical of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is look in the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
You laugh and <unk> and it gives itself these <unk> big <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this, and he asked me to think, when before we do this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, it doesn't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 years old, and he's living in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be cherished and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, although his mom tells him all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
Among what his mom says and what his friends, or the school of the school they say, don't know who you believe.
So a video of her, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others that please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenage teenager who receives these answers into one of their most vulnerable life stages of their lives.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in their most young girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it bringing to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected, so it still <unk> so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures on the hand with that is <unk>
This environment, of being always connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of <unk> that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is rigged digitally.
What is the biggest thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> follow our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those that <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to do with what young people compare to.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all of this?
Well, we probably want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in an culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to make care of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and others start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer to not do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for the growth as human beings, and as taxpayers to the field of working development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> debates participate in the classroom <unk> because they don't want to call attention to their physical form.
One of five aren't attending at all the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you look at good enough, specifically if you don't think you're happy enough -- you will take a lower note to the average of your peers who don't care about what it looks like.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it gets regardless of what these young people are.
So, to be good of course, we're talking about how you look at it, not as you are.
<unk> on their body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet not healthy that they can bring to a food mess with it.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> for the people around the surrounding and they're at higher risk of depression.
And we think it's all about what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol and drugs, diet -- aesthetic surgery, sexual relationships to ages ages and no protection and harm damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe are overweight again, regardless of whether or don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day that they don't feel secure in the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be that opportunity?
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We have to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very amazed by when I learned that a lot of math shows that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it.
So we need to make sure that the program that we follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and <unk>
These six aspects are critical points for anyone who will provide an education education in body self-esteem that works.
One education is fundamental -- but to tackle this problem requires each of us to take the reins in the business and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
It challenging today's status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our politicians at <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people for what they are, not as you see.
We can all start doing it by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, When was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow their entire person to grow their whole person to valuing individuality, diversity, <unk>
We have to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
Let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never going to have never been <unk> of being who they are, or reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are in mind?
It's his <unk>
It's his <unk>
It's his <unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
It could just be just the woman who is just two feet away, what would it mean for her if he was liberated from that voice <unk> in her interior, that he would take him for not to have long legs -- <unk> more <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were going to do this and apply it to its potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is <unk>
But let's turn our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
It would lead to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, become security agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
The five November, of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> came to a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
As initially they were declared initially an innocent thing, but being prisoner for other minor charges in the company, they started planning on attacks at about 12 icons from New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily those plans were <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center wasn't able to avoid.
Later on, she would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a <unk> mother, an American school teacher among the two did all the possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
And I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all of the human group, there's always a small fraction of people who are going to be so <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all the possible means that everyone lived as them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat down with me and explained that over the last few weekends, he and some friends, had been running at <unk> in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go on the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold my father on the shoulder and explained how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet I shot -- I gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise you, especially me, all the goal broke on flames.
My uncle came back to others and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
Of such a parent, a child.
But all of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be committed to put a stick with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the North Trade Trade Trade Center causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had already moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone now it was time to pack and go to another city.
As long as I was the new face of the class I was often victim <unk>
<unk> <unk> my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So the bulk of the time was going on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, to say it <unk> <unk> <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
I was reminded of the opera to judge people, based on indicators -- <unk> as your race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they set up to test my way to think, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National <unk> <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been victim <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had done that friendship, was Jewish age.
It took several days out to the light that I realized there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that all life was made to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> a park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience turned fundamental to the development of my character.
The whole life was taught that <unk> was a sin and, for extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I wish I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy for suffering from others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat people -- exactly the way I wish to be treated.
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is of the closet, but I know what it is to be <unk> by something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me an honest thing about my <unk> and helping me see that race from people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my shape <unk> at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
Instead, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that preserving my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with his eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else is trying to get to the violence, who is trying to take my story and understand that there is a better way that even though I gave myself to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't have to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk about these acts of meaning, like rejection to the actions of my father.
With this <unk> I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, which children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk> film.
It's in 3D, and it has sound <unk> of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> flavor and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood moments in front of your eyes.
And it's constantly a <unk> voice on your conscious of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in work.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie -- you know, you and you.
There is nothing to get more directly.
At least, I know I have a <unk>
I don't sure you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just the robots that we're going to get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, no one knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective to.
<unk> by nature, is subjective stuff.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we would take that vision.
Science was studying behavioral behavior, the neuroscience is studying the brain -- but nobody has never mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> as Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for the science of <unk> science.
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that featured Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a rocket science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience is answers to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the problems.
<unk> to <unk>
In fact, there's no easy problem with consciousness.
So it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an inner <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn it into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how the <unk> work <unk> how they work <unk> how <unk> are adapted and <unk> the living organisms, all these are questions about how it works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we <unk> how we are going to play <unk> all of them questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why everything is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end of the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for reasons that were <unk>
I think we're going to get away at this point.
We have a wonderful basic explanations chain, so we got used to this; the physics explains chemistry, explains chemistry, explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to break that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning, crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Its crazy idea is that there is no difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective <unk> movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of changing functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and so he studies everything that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely purely <unk> <unk> in the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I'm going in a different direction.
In the time you get off, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
It makes fundamental laws that <unk> them as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These core laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything more fundamental.
Instead, it's fundamental principles, and there is actually built the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, <unk> laws of Newton. So <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- <unk> -- <unk> <unk> then a question of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural would be <unk> as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it's suddenly not the object of science.
It opens up the way to break scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, laws that connect consciousness with other concepts fundamental concepts -- space, time, the mass, the physical processes.
<unk> sometimes say that we want fundamental core laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> -- every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think about it, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> some very early precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think about so <unk>
So in part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a really fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing information, there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human human <unk>
<unk> of simple, simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in the recent recent years, a <unk> <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it with <unk> methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And it's supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a way of integration of information integration -- just quite significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the bush microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different awareness level of zero.
In fact, providing a fundamental law of the <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers are often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies the bottom.
As Stephen Hawking's explains how the fire comes out of the <unk>
From <unk> <unk> the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> <unk> has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have really serious social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical implications.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should never eat anything that had consciousness, then it should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think I thought, well, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms, and <unk> is not so much the fact that the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has an complicated, integrated information, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are very serious ethical problems about the ethic of development of intelligent computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk -- at this time we have a collective collective consciousness -- an internal film for this whole TED group, different from the inner movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question you must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going to be the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for <unk> at night to tomorrow.
But I think we finally go to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village on Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, an underwater profile.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, and I was <unk> with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to go on for an award of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a single problem.
She actually hasn't gotten anything.  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had an underwater profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class of <unk> <unk> a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to move your <unk>
And I said, "What is <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on the wheelchair, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration.
And we don't know it, and it's not <unk> that is true for many of us.
For us, the disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably hope you're waiting for you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have been sold to be the lie that disability is a <unk>  cap <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability to make you a fantastic deal.
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't get to make you <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your <unk> is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one of the girl with no hand drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with little carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn <unk> because we would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will engage the disabled ones in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that saying.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've lost the number of times that have been talking to me that I think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was <unk> for the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with disability in the benefit of people without disabilities.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not that bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
We have some things.
But the things that we are eating is not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> because I was <unk> by the so-called social model of the disability, that tells us that we are more disabled because of society in which we live because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
And the things I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of your capacity as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of lying, because they've sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration and you think, "Oh God, you're not going to be inspired by any times inspired by anything?"
And I actually know that I am.
<unk> of other disabled people at all.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall around --  -- <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge the battery cell phone on the battery <unk>
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that has been sold to us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is lie is because it's not real, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in a stick stick has not done it becomes a <unk>
Never.    (Audience <unk>   <unk> to a television screen, will not make the <unk> for the <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude turning all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not seen by being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people who are disability to be <unk> because you stand up from the bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the rest of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child from 11 grade in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair.
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but questioning what you think about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to do is to see augmented reality and soccer with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just answering one of those questions, so please don't get off.
When people think actually <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because behavioral reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the reality of <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would do with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game of <unk> <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man 110 pounds of <unk> trying to <unk> them with all his self.
I've been there and I assure you that's not nice.
You know, some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of emerging technology is an underwater rising up to the surface.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment -- <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field from the perspective of <unk>
You may have noticed that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, being their favorite players -- and they have asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get out of <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that probably many of you know.
The Rift Death has been described as the most realistic reality apparatus ever created, and it's not a cheap difference.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, what?
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a <unk> video crossing across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before running and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of fan.
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> throwing the ball into the bottom of the network? Or <unk> by doing a <unk> in <unk>
What is your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to the reality of <unk> reality.
<unk> advanced reality when I <unk> the <unk> and the owners look at the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a short review of technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore was put together a <unk> to his <unk> in the field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed radios on the <unk> of the <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to your group, and you see his next approach to you in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on in front of you in front of you will not have to worry about to forget a <unk>
Or you have to memorize the strategy.
They just come out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be having a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that you're already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad will have information <unk>
And this is <unk> the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being just for nerds.
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's the field.
It <unk> the ball and <unk>
They went to a open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your Norden bombsight -- that a defense behind you is going to <unk> normally, but the <unk> system will be <unk>
Let's get to the protection.
Another <unk> you will tell you that there's a open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the receptor sees in your bombsight -- an area of grass that lights and can modify the career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed it from every angle.
This is something to create a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our native entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show somebody how it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is it worth this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions is from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show you the world how they live <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as long as we do.
Thank you.
I recently joined me after 23 years of service.
Most of those 23 years ago, I spent the end of the South County <unk> which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known by its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer <unk> <unk> to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is essentially <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from his openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring it to another dimension, and this bridge has been <unk> as a bridge has been <unk> so that the fall from he frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to make suicide.
After a drop of four to five seconds, the body hits water about 120 miles an hour.
The <unk> impact is the bones, some of which we were using vital organs.
Most of the population dies in the impact.
The ones that don't normally get <unk> in the water -- and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that <unk> this suicide method is to realize the death of the death that is <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 steel inches a bridge.
So here is where most people are in order to take their lives.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking with a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had a success day to bring it back over the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans veterans and psychologists train the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at 22 o'clock in the past year to receive a call of a possible <unk> subject sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got here, I looked at Jason talking with a named Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years ago and had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity was more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
It was stopped about <unk> leaned on the right, and it did.
This kind of clever guy in New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had taken it.
damage damage damage is affecting a lot of people.
I give you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved it <unk>
What do you do?
So what does it say?
In my experience, it's not just to talk, but you have to listen.
I'll listen to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person who you know how it feels because they probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of us can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs at <unk> despair, believing things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believing that there is nothing you can do with <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you his letter.
She lost his son the 19th of January this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it is with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience.
I'm thinking that I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell their friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but I will see more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father the 19 of January.
It never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness I'd seen it from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who has not been wrong with a real mental illness.
It must not be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
<unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and to walk on the way that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March of March 2005, I wrote to a radio call for a possible subject suicide bomber on the sidewalk near the <unk>
I put my foot on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me, it crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and the next time, I heard as Kevin spoke about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to figure that day back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came up with it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What was the thing that he did to <unk> and gave him the hope and the other one <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I get <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the <unk> events and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like it says.
We give God for you.
I posed a debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> When I visited the General General in San Francisco that night, you were <unk> as the patient.
I know I had it to <unk>
Currently, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I have found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk>
That act, despite finishing his own pain, theft.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain.
Usually this is just three things: to sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And for that time, I would hold my hand at three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, these few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or two -- most of those people have said that the second one that they leave next to the railing noticed that they had made a mistake, and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but people are also <unk>
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be working on to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question you can tell you, how do you get in that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I had finally accomplished the dream that I had since a little girl.
My outside end was finally <unk> with my truth inside my inner myself.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to talk about later, when I look at this picture I'm thinking, you managed to put it up, <unk> it.
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm starting to start.
<unk> our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
They are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, a lot of my friends, my <unk> even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I had a little bit of <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember at my five years in my house, and I always wore this t-shirt in the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why always take that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never want to share my story, not because I thought that being wrong, but why the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many aren't so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who reflects these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a beautiful beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever been engaged in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I was <unk> she was responsible for <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won the bathroom, won in <unk> and she was third <unk> among over 40 generations, a third <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of <unk>
Not many people can say that their first job was about queen of beauty of women -- but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom who had moved to San Francisco, he had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me to passed my own green card that I could go to live in the United States.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was left in Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time, in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the car license, with the name of <unk> and gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was your driver's license, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many aren't so fortunate.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living his truth, but that <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 November, we make a global <unk> by the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who are <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others to live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
They'll do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you   <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. Well, first to thank with all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been <unk> and sometimes when they called me and sometimes when they called me and they told me that their parents couldn't embrace it, I took on the phone, and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned us an gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table that some times that would not block, and that should have a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The gay movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very kind. <unk> Thank you.
In many societies, <unk> societies are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who know her for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education by defending their rights in 2007. And when they took their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the National <unk> National <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when you born a child, your birth was not <unk>
It's not welcoming and his father, or his mother.
The neighborhood comes out, gives her mother to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother was <unk> a lot for having a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, she feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only is the mother suffering, but the daughter, <unk> daughter <unk> when it goes, she suffers from too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and the school stood at their brothers.
At the age of 12 years, somehow, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when he was 13 years old, he is about to go out of her house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls in your house.
It's no longer an free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his brothers and his family, and if he <unk> the code of that assumption would even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and happiness of his sisters in behalf of honor.
And there's one more norm of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and to embrace the decisions of their father and their mother and people's decisions even if you don't want it.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man, you have to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young, it has to embrace it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens in the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then it gives birth to more and <unk>
And the irony is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to her daughter and the same lesson from honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my feather, and I grabbed a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she carried out when she was four and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can take it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many countries, but in the poorer countries, in the industrialized countries, in tribal societies is a huge event for the family of a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of your identity and his name.
And a testament to school means that it's in the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I <unk> the <unk> <unk> form and was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate intelligence and <unk> from my daughter.
I was looking at me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to figure out their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and kids like the same.
I used education to <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
He was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation of women in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned from going to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and let them go to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls <unk> and the singers that were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the 10 years, <unk> got up and got up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the nervous blog he was offered to her himself for the documentaries of the New York Times, and I talked to each platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It's <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the nine in October of 2012, was caught in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he told him to my wife -- "I've got <unk> so I spent my daughter, to your <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please don't bother you."
<unk> the fair cause.
You know, your life in play because of the cause of peace, because of the cause of peace, and the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe migraine headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please don't get off.
It was a solace for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when they didn't turn their task.
You fight with her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is the special thing in my <unk> that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I mean, I don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work I'm talking about here about the science of the brain, I made it before I met Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to an operation of brain.
You are still as smart or not?
It's not like that, you can be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It was not gray, matter, but it was the <unk> part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from over a dozen chemical powerful every day, because if I didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and trying to keep it out of <unk>
More than I've saved a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that it will be <unk> to try to get the invasive dose, because it really doesn't have a map that says it in <unk>
I started to try and try and try and get different <unk> and I was amazed at looking at how small changes in the <unk> dramatically my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried doses and typical chemical doses for a man in Beijing, and I was just amazed to see how to look at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all of the time in the sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of them.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> so much <unk> to fix a problem with the front, and it simply didn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do, from then I have better with men.
What I was trying to do is adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking -- my <unk> of ideas.
<unk> thinking about it almost always in pictures, and that became my key reference point -- how do you get those mental imaging that I use to create <unk> my ideas -- if you get <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in the same way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are those who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works. For me it's simple: for most of us, the mental imagery is fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> -- really sophisticated <unk> very sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use their imagination only to steer the world to the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way the creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments that was done by two groups leading into neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image by functional MRI, in order to represent the brain here, you can see brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows your brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The center of the brain shows the brain scan of that same individual while you're looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the left column on the left, and you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This was repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine to see that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab from Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual fields in visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube videos, while their brains are taking their brains to create a big <unk> reaction to the video sequences.
And then they showed them a movie with new images, new animals, new animals, and as long as we get together a new <unk>
The computer -- using just the brain information on the scan of what it looks like that the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're very close to this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain scanning brain imaging systems available today, and its resolution to increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce you.
I don't offer that one.
Many of them are proposing new projection techniques by images, including me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets <unk> only little improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands of us as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of the bigger magnets -- make better magnets out.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make magnets really big, right?
And yet, most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever and bright solutions in coding and <unk> in <unk> and <unk> radio signs in MRI systems.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field -- they were moving through magnetic patterns and <unk> by the frequencies of radio radio.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the <unk> radio processing patterns we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide our knowledge into the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the neural neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas in direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly by <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's disease and similar disease.
We have a few more choices to open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay ego.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet may be telling some person for the first time that he loves him, or telling someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to do in life.
And all sorts of interest is a hard conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and having come out of that closet is universal.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope by the <unk> of my short <unk> and I would have <unk> my head -- I would usually ask a child -- "Hey, you're a kid or a <unk>
And it would appear a silence at the table.
I got my jaw a little bit more, I would take me with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother beat a cold, look at her son.
But I would not say anything, and I went through it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to get into the female issues on the table.  He had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a snippet of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I would take a breath in and my back and my back to my back a little girl in four years with a pink dress with a little pink dress -- looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist, just a girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so I cut it down as much as it again, I got out of <unk> about her, and I said, "Hey, do I know this is a bit better.
I have the short hair like the one guy, and I saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like you to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more than the girl from a <unk> pajamas.
And that little girl looked at me, paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and it has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was the whole thing, you can just do it. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that we <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I myself, we were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you a hundred reasons why I get out of my closet -- it was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> it's hard for <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who have declared banking on banking banking is harder than telling you it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult to say to your three-year-old son who are going to be <unk>
There is no more difficult thing, there's only the hard one.
We need to stop classifying what it is difficult to do with how hard to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to only feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel safety, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls, a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse -- a horse and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight any child in four years that would fit the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet -- <unk> my gay, "Would you just move a muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends who I've spent my whole life trying to do not survive, and now the world would turn on purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't launch that <unk> you will kill.
One of the most memorable launches was in the wedding of my sister.
It was the first time that many guests who knew that I was gay, and when I was doing the <unk> of honor, in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally I got to one where the friends were my parents, people who I knew was years of years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women said, <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we heard that it's <unk>
You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but I would expect to desperately show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses a <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like all the <unk> of <unk>
It could have been easy to indicate where he felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
That's how hard conversations are still without being my strong point.
Ask anybody with anyone who has been <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it implies is coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must be able to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> Just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will keep hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate their truth.
It would never be <unk> by that.
And some of them can be injured legally <unk> because they have never been sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some may feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story it matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very themselves, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has seen a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is so interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When I was <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism for pioneers of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we would take a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Go back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you have a passenger race that you don't know anything about the Earth of the Earth or the neuroscience of Earth or the Earth or the Earth or some incredible telescopes you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about it, that doesn't have any concept on the Earth, it doesn't have any concept on the Earth, you would see a physics theory that explain how, even at the time in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet -- you stop it.
And so I claim that this is the same question of understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program I conducted several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues across the science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying intelligence mechanism.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately accurately for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we would bring the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action to perform complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked myself, from a number of years ago, there is a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence I've ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force -- F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action -- or keeping your open choices with a force -- with the diversity of possible future women, even to an impending future, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
Identity is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep it open.
And so having in account this equation, it's natural <unk> what can you do with this?
How <unk> it is?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should be able to have more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more inclusive relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with production of entropy in the long term, but it actually comes directly from her?
To find out, we've developed an software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of the long-term entropy in any system that you find in.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple testing of animal intelligence, play human games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without the right thing to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human foot without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to be able to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance are going to have apps for humanoid robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling away from extreme edges of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see a successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the serious <unk>
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications for health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, and discovering it successfully and using the Panama Canal to extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of <unk> <unk> increasing the assets under their controlled exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have massive applications in finance, secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tools, walking upright and social cooperation and all derived from an equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to at the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion in it.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest implications of this work is that maybe all of these decades -- we've had all the concept of rebellion to the other way.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all other other than the impulse to take control of all future future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence can actually actually arise directly from taking control instead of being the other way.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
And often they ask me, "How do you look for goals from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants to help help them build artificial artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be view as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how the Earth works in the context of the universe.
The NASA Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which orbit around other stars, which is that the Earth is only one of the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint intensity of the stars when the planets go through the front of them, and they put a little bit of that light that you go.
The data collected by Kepler showing the sizes of planets besides the distance that there are between them and their mother.
And then this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own sake.
At the time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure. of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now they're disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on to a global scale have rapidly <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist or the <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, hopefully finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, the more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better from our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world demonstrated this by a mission like this.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and partly because of it that we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track its surface to search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission, take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not only short space flights but also the <unk> of living on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images remind us of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still going to be <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and the highest of the Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement from the colonization, of Mars and other planets will take a large and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that we expect to expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet we know that it's truly livable on Earth.
And so I like the exploration of <unk> I'm deep in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there to encourage humanity to humanity is like imagine that the captain of Titanic will tell us that the <unk> really will have a place later on <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for climate exploration and preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve the life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk>
Just that they find closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep spaces <unk> in the hostile areas and <unk> in the ground, maybe we could satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked me in account that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we would save this development.
It's arrogant to think that just colonization we will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to do that to hostile environments for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the right task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, <unk> my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table, where there was <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all pretty well.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> would take a long time to get it up, and it was cold.
I couldn't get home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight in Europe to the next morning, and I went out of my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but you're sure not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, even though the circumstances, I was very afraid.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases your heart rate -- <unk> your adrenaline levels, and then <unk>
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in his place, which would make bad things happen.
Or at least, if you happen to be bad things, that we will make the probability of a total of a disaster.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month after my thoughts don't <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> and a little embarrassed I talked about the Nobel Prize, and I had forgotten my passport, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny <unk> who had been practicing with something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might go wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things that were happening or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not that evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
And in the house, they would take a place for the things that are very easily.
This sounds of common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where the noise are fine, where the fish are, where the fish are going on, where the tribes live in and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if someone really asked if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and still they could find their nuts.
They don't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose your car <unk> reading and <unk>
So at home, I would put a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular discussion.
For your reading glasses -- a particular <unk>
If you put a place and you get a little bit <unk> with it that you will always be there when you <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card license, passport, <unk> by mail themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
